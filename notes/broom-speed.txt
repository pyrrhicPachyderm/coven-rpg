Drag force is given by F = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * C_D * A, where rho is the density of air, v is velocity, C_D is the drag coefficient, and A is the cross-sectional area.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skydiving#Terminal_Velocity (accessed 22 Jan 2020), drawing from https://cnx.org/exports/be308439-f9b1-40e7-b0a6-1631cbc7feaa@8.pdf/drag-forces-8.pdf, gives figures for most of these, in two positions; head-down, and belly-to-earth.
We will take belly-to-earth for a sidesaddle witch, and head-down for a witch sitting astride her broom (and tucked tight against it).
This gives the drag coefficient as about 1 when sidesaddle, and about 0.7 when astride.
Cross-sectional area is about 0.7 square metres when sidesaddle, and about 0.18 square metres when astride.

Air density at sea level, at 20 degrees Celsius, is around 1.2 kilograms per cubic metre.

This gives F = 0.42 * v^2 when sidesaddle, and F = 0.0756 * v^2 when astride.

The next step is to determine what force a witch can hang onto a broomstick in the face of.

Sitting in a sidesaddle position on a vertical pole is clearly infeasible, so it must be a force of less than 1 g.
Sitting on a pole at a 45 degree angle is doable, however.
This pits you against a force along the pole of sqrt(1/2) g.
Call this 0.7 g, and assume it is the limit.

Hanging from a vertical pole, with arms and legs, is feasible, suggesting a force of at least 1 g.
Asking a few people suggests they might be able to support around 1.4 times their own body weight in such a way, for a while.
Allowing that a witch braces her feet against the bristles, assume she can sustain this for a while, and take a limit of 1.4 g.

Take an average weight woman of around 60 kg.
Taking g to be 9.8 metres per second, this gives force limits of 411.6 newtons for a sidesaddle witch, and 823.2 newtons for a witch astride.

Sidesaddle:
411.6 = 0.42 * v^2
v = sqrt(411.6/0.42)
v = 31.3 m/s
112.68 km/h

Astride:
823.2 = 0.0756 * v^2
v = sqrt(832.2/0.0756)
v = 104.9 m/s
377.64 km/h

NB: When I first performed these calculations, I made a mistake.
I dropped a factor of 6 in the force limit calculations, giving final speeds a factor of sqrt(6) lower than this (46 and 174 km/h).
These speeds give most people a nice modern-day sense, and work quite well from a balance sense, as well as seeming far more reasonable.
So I will use these speeds.
A factor of a little over 2 is easily explainable as problems with speed wobble, as these calculations haven't accounted for the effect of air resistance on balance anyway.
Lastly, I can note that Tests can increase speed up to about double, making the limits calculated here more hard limits.

Rounding these, we can take figures of 50 and 150 kilometres per hour.
Using a very rough conversion of 10 km/h to 3 m/s, this gives 15 and 45 m/s, or 150 and 450 metres per round.
