\section{Statistics}

When a {\mind} is separated from a body, or a body is {\possessed} by another {\mind}, it may be necessary to calculate the statistics of the resulting entity.
\capital{\attref{might}}, \attref{grace}, \statref{resilience}, and \statref{speed} are properties of the body.
The other six attributes, all skills, and all feats are properties of the {\mind}.
The traits of familiars and other creatures usually properties of the {\body}, but a few would more reasonbly be considered to be properties of the {\mind}, or even a combination of the two; the GM should use their best judgement to decide.
\capital{\damage} is a property of the body, as are any ongoing effects of brews consumed by the body.

When a new {\mind} enters a body, simply combine the statistics of the body and the {\mind} to get the statistics of the resulting entity.
\capital{\statref{shock-threshold}} and \statref{dodge-rating} are a product of the combination of the body and {\mind}: recalculate them using the \attref{might} and \attref{grace} of the body, and the \attref{will} and \attref{ken} of the {\mind}, with the \statref{shock-threshold} reduced by any {\damage} sustained by the body.

A {\mind} without a body, loose in the {\mentalrealm}, does not have a \attref{might}, \attref{grace}, or \statref{speed}.
None of these statistics would be relevant in the {\mentalrealm} regardless: a {\mind} cannot affect the physical world without a body, and movement in the {\mentalrealm} is done by thinking, rather than walking or running.

A body without an occupying {\mind} does not have any attributes other than \attref{might} or \attref{grace}.
However, even these attributes are of reduced relevance, as it lies unmoving without an occupying {\mind}.
It cannot even stand or sit up on its own, and slumps wherever it is left.
An unoccupied body has no \stateref{dodge-rating}; attacks automatically hit it.
An unoccupied body still has a \statref{shock-threshold}, which is calculated as though it had 0 \attref{might}.
