\discipline{Divination}{divination}{Seer}{Seers}

\dropcapdiscref{divination} is the art of seeing, hearing, and otherwise sensing in ways that are not normally possible.
Many witches consider it to be a very narrow and limited discipline.
In many ways, they are right.
It certainly lacks the versatility of \discref{willing}.
In fact, it lacks \discrefpossessive{willing} ability to affect the world at all.

Rather, \practitioners{divination}---as the practitioners of \discref{divination} are called---tend to rely on enhanced knowledge and awareness.
It's all very well, they say, having the power to crush a man beneath a ton of rock, but which man to crush?
Was he the one who did the crime?
And where's he run off to now?
With {\foretelling}, it may be possible to stop him before he even commits the crime.
After all, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and a single arrow can change the world if you know just where to put it.

Despite its seemingly narrow focus, \discref{divination} still covers a fairly wide gamut of abilities.
The simplest just enhance an existing sense, allowing a witch to see in the dark, for example.
Some, such as \featref{divination-location}, grant an entirely new sense.
Perhaps the most interesting, however, are \featref{scrying}, \featref{hindsight}, and \featref{foresight}.
These allow the witch to see distant locations, the past, and even the future.

In terms of the necessary equipment, \discref{divination} sits between the extremes of \discref{willing} and \discref{ritual-magic}.
Much of it, particularly simple enhancements to a witch's senses, requires nothing beyond a witch's eyes or ears, and sometimes not even those.
In fact, many of these abilities require essentially no ongoing effort from the witch; once she knows the trick of it, it's as easy as opening her eyes.
Some \discref{divination}, however---particularly sensing distant locations---requires a lot more concentration and equipment.
\capital{\featref{scrying}} requires a surface to look through, and several abilities require an object to focus upon, to find the right time or location to sense.

\capital{\attref{heed}} is the most important attribute in \discref{divination}.
The discipline is entirely about extending one's awareness, and a witch who is blind to her own surroundings in the first place is going to have a hard time looking any further afield.

\section{Foretelling}
\seclabel{foretelling}

For many witches, telling the future is the most enticing part of \discref{divination}.
It is, however, the trickiest.

In truth, nobody has ever managed to see their own future.
To know one's own fate, but to do \emph{nothing} to avoid it, is a level of self-discipline beyond any \practitioner{divination} the world has yet seen.
And without that self-discipline, the future is simply inscrutable---it seems almost to be defending itself against change.

But witches wouldn't be witches if they hadn't found a way to cheat.
You can't see your own future, but you can see the next closest thing.
So foretelling, such as it is practised, is a matter of forking the stream of time, of tossing a rock into the flow and sending it thundering down two different channels.
There is a moment in every foretelling ritual, or spell, where the \practitioner{divination} goes two ways.
On one branch, she completes the ritual.
On the other, she stops abruptly halfway through, stands up, and goes about her life none the wiser.
It is the world of the second \practitioner{divination} that the first \practitioner{divination} sees.

Most \practitioners{divination} treat this as a metaphor, of course.
They've never \emph{actually} abandoned the ritual halfway through, no matter how many times they've seen themselves do it.
But some do wonder if those copies of themselves exist out there somewhere, even the ones they've seen die.

\subsection{The World Foretold}

All in all, a \practitioner{divination} performing foretelling sees visions of the world as it would turn out if she did not perform this foretelling.
So long as she does not interfere, she may assume that things will proceed, for the most part, the same.
But, as she changes more things, the worlds will diverge further, until her predictions become useless.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that sitting still in a dark room, doing nothing, doesn't mean a \practitioner{divination} is not interfering.
In the world where she performed no divination, the one she has peered in on, she likely acted, going out and doing whatever she normally did.
By sitting still in this world, she leaves out the results of those actions, probably rendering her predictions inaccurate quite quickly.

As such, the best way to keep predictions accurate for as long as possible is to act as though she never made them in the first place, going about as though she were blind to the future.
It will never work indefinitely, but she might be able to keep it up for a while.

\subsection{Foretelling \& the Metagame}

Telling the future is tricky not only for a witch, in character, but also for the GM running the game.
Giving good visions requires the GM to predict how events would play out, assuming the \practitioner{divination} had no foreknowledge.
This requires more planning than some GMs might want to do.

Furthermore, it often requires predicting how the player's characters would act, which can cause problems.
The GM is free to ask the players themselves, if that won't give away any plot details that the vision itself won't.
It can even be fun to play out the world where the \practitioner{divination} did not perform her foretelling, before jumping back to the point of the foretelling with the \practitionerpossessive{divination} new knowledge and playing again from there.
That can grow tedious, of course---it should be used sparingly, and with the agreement of everyone at the table.

Most importantly, both the players and the GM should be understanding that telling the future is tricky business.
Everyone should be willing to forgive mistakes, and to try and resolve everything coherently.
And if everything is just too much, the GM can request that players simply avoid the more troublesome feats.
Even then, feats such as \featref{divination-initiative} and \featref{divination-dodge} allow for witches who can see the future without requiring the GM to invent visions.

\subsection{Foretelling as a Plot Device}

Prophecies and visions are an ancient staple of myths and legends, as well as contemporary literature.
GMs should feel free to use foretelling as a device in creating plots for the game.
This may use the visions provided by a player character's feats, other omens, or visions imparted upon a \practitioner{divination}, or a non-player \practitioner{divination}.

One aspect to play with as part of a plot is the assumption that no \practitioner{divination} can see their own future.
Just because no \practitioner{divination} has had the self-discipline to manage it yet, doesn't mean that it is impossible.
Any plot violating this assumption must be very carefully executed, to avoid taking agency away from the players, but can be very effective if it is done well.
Just remember that witches are notorious cheats---even predestined events are only fixed to the extent that they've been seen, and can always be staged.

\section{Visions of the Past and Future}
\seclabel{visions}

The counterpart to seeing the future, {\foretelling}, is seeing the past; often called hindsight.
This carries some important difference to {\foretelling}.
For one thing; it's easier.
The past has already happened; it's right there for looking at.
Secondly, it's always accurate.
Looking at the future inevitably changes it, so that what you see isn't quite what will wind up happening.
Looking at the past, however, does nothing to change it.
The other side of this, of course, is that it's too late to change it, even if you want to.

Despite the differences, however, {\visions} of the past and the future have a lot in common.
This section lays out the mechanics of such {\visions}, as used by the \featref{hindsight} and \featref{foresight} feats.

Firstly, the feat that grants you the {\vision} defines the period of time that the {\vision} covers.
For \featref{hindsight}, this period of time is always the entire past, from the present moment, as far back as you can reach.
\capital{\featref{foresight}}, however, is less stable.
Its {\visions} begin at a particular time---some time in the future---and run for a fixed length of time after that.
You can end them early, but you can never run them beyond that time.

For a novice witch, time within a {\vision} simply plays from one end to the other, at normal speed.
With \featref{foresight}, time plays forward, from the beginning of the {\vision} to the end.
With \featref{hindsight}, time plays backwards, from the present moment until the witch stops maintaining the {\vision}.
More experienced witches will learn to break these rules, of course.

While in a {\vision}, you see, hear, and otherwise sense around the current location of your body.
However, your senses detect what was, or will be, happening at the time you are looking in on.
For example, with \featref{hindsight}, you could enter a room, then look backwards to see what happened in a room before you entered it.

\capital{\visions} affect all senses except touch.
You see, hear, smell, and taste the time you are looking in on.
You benefit from any enhancements to these senses, such as \featref{darkvision}, and even from entirely new senses, such as those granted by \featref{divination-location}, \featref{divination-taglock-location}, or \featref{death-detection}.
You cannot use {\visions} within the {\mentalrealm}---or even sense the {\mentalrealm} at all---without the feat \featref{vision-projection}.

Your sense of touch, however, remains in the present time.
You cannot touch anything from the past or future, and people in these times can even walk straight through you---quite a disturbing experience.
A {\vision} renders you blind, deaf, and otherwise insensate to your current surroundings; only touch keeps you connected to the present.
Someone trying to bring you out of a {\vision} is advised to tap you on the shoulder; you won't sense anything but a touch.

You may end a {\vision} at any time you choose, at which point your senses immediately snap back to the present.
The {\vision} also ends if you fall asleep, fall unconscious, or, in the case of \featref{foresight}, you reach the end of its allotted period of time.

You may act normally during a {\vision}; knitting, talking, even pacing.
You cannot sense what you're doing except through touch, which can make things quite difficult.
Walls don't tend to move too much, however---as long as you are looking at the immediate past or future---so you can hopefully avoid walking into those.

Although you can move about during a {\vision}, a novice cannot hold a {\vision} together if they move too far from where they began it.
The {\vision} breaks down and ends if you move too far from where you began it; you can manage a couple of metres without trouble, or more with a {\test}.
\capital{\featref{vision-move}} lifts this limitation.

The limitation of only being able to see the area around where you are currently standing is quite a major one, but there are a couple of things you can do to lift it, making use of \featref{scrying}.
While in a {\vision}, you can see any scrying images that existed in the time and place you are looking at.
With \featref{foresight} in particular, you might be able to look at yourself scrying in the future.
This is far harder to arrange with \featref{hindsight}, however, and does not work at all with \featref{scrying-eyes}.
The more reliable solution is to use the feat \featref{vision-scrying}.

\section{Portents}
\seclabel{portents}

A witch who first learns to {\foretell} the future, with \featref{foresight}, must explicitly choose the time she wants to see in her {\visions}.
For example, she might choose to have a {\vision} of what will happen in 8 hours' time.
Having a {\vision} of a specific or useful event in this way may be quite difficult: if she doesn't know when the event is scheduled to occur, she'll need to estimate it by some sort of dead reckoning.
To make {\foretelling} easier and more useful, many \practitioners{divination} learn to interpret and use {\portents}: signs and techniques that they can use to aim their {\foretelling} {\visions}.
\capital{\portents} can be learned through the relevant feats, each of which teaches how to use a different type of {\portent}, such as spilled entrails or \materialrefplural{tarot}.

Using a {\portent} requires you to study the {\portent} while beginning your {\vision}.
The {\portent} must be present for you to study for the whole time it takes to begin a {\vision}.
Each type of {\portent} searches the time \featref{foresight} would normally allow you to view for a particular event, and shows you a {\vision} of that event.
The event it shows must be one that occurs in the location of the {\vision}: in your immediate surroundings by default, or at the current location of the scrying sensor when used in combination with \featref{vision-scrying}.

Normally, a {\portent} searches for the event within the entire time period that you could see a {\vision} of with \featref{foresight}.
However, you may also choose to search a shorter or more specific time if you wish.
For example, you could search only within the next hour, or search within the afternoon while ignoring any occurrences in the morning.

Some {\portents} search for the event that most fulfils some criterion, and thus will always show a valid {\vision}.
For example, \featref{portent-entrails} shows the most violent event, and will still show a {\vision} of someone stubbing their toe if that's the most applicable event available.
Other {\portents}, such as \featref{portent-chance} search for a specific event.
If that event does not occur in the location and time period being searched, \featref{foresight} will simply fail, and the \practitioner{divination} will see no {\vision}.

\subsection{Portent's Muse}
\seclabel{portent-muses}

Some {\portents} use a {\muse}: a creature or person used to inspire and guide the {\portent}.
If a {\portent} requires a {\muse}, you must watch the {\musepossessive} behaviour while you study the {\portent}.
They must remain in sight for as long as it takes you to begin a {\vision}, but you may watch them via \featref{scrying} if it helps.
Some {\portents} allow you to use yourself as a {\muse}, in which case no observation is necessary.

How the {\muse} of a {\portent} is used will depend upon the {\portent}, and will be specified in the relevant feat.
Note that this is not necessarily the person upon whom the resulting {\vision} will focus: see \featref{portent-aim-taglock} for that.
For some types of {\portent}, the {\muse} may not even appear in the {\vision}.

	Your eyes, magically assisted, can pick up the barest traces of light.
	You suffer no penalties in low-light conditions, though you are as blind as anyone in complete darkness.
	This works even if you are standing in light and looking into darkness.
}

\feat{Darkvision}{darkvision-2}{10}{
	\skillref[1]{divination},

	You no longer need light, so fickle and often absent, to see.
	This works as \featref{darkvision}, except it also works in complete darkness.
}

\feat{Unclouded Vision}{xray-vision}{10}{
	\skillref[1]{divination},
	\featref{darkvision}
}{
	Translucent substances, such as fog, murky water, or dust storms, do not obscure or distort your vision.
	Intermediate cases, such as a leafy canopy or dense cobwebs, can be seen through with a \testtype{heed}{divination} {\test}.
}

\feat{Blindsight}{blindsight}{15}{
	\skillref[2]{divination},
	\featref{darkvision-2}
}{
	You no longer need to use your eyes to see.
	You cannot be blinded, or have your vision impaired.
	
	This covers mundane afflictions, such as grit in your eyes, or having your eyes gouged out, as well as effects such as a \featref{smell-potion}, or being transformed into a blind animal.
	Other divination feats, however, such as \featref{scrying-eyes}, blind you at deeper level.
	This offers you no protection against them.
	Furthermore, this feat offers no immunity to the \featref{headology-remove-sense} feat, although knowing that you cannot be blinded makes it much harder to convince you that you have been.
	
	Likewise, this doesn't make you immune to a blindfold, or a bag over your head.
	You're still seeing out from your eyes, or your eye sockets if those are gone.
}

\feat{Eyes in the Back of Your Head}{360-vision}{15}{
	\skillref[1]{divination}
}{
	You can see behind you.
	In fact you can see all around yourself; 360 degrees, plus up and down.
	This makes you far harder to sneak up on, and lets you observe someone without looking in their direction.
	The GM may give a bonus to \skillref{perception} {\tests} relying on spotting something that you might not be looking at.
	
	This feat does not literally give you any extra eyes, and only works as long as you can see normally.
	However, it also works when looking through a \featref{scrying} surface, allowing you to see out in all directions from the sensor.
}

\feat{Perfect Positioning}{divination-location}{10}{
	\noprereq
}{
	While much of \discref{divination} deals in sensing the future, the past, or distant locations, there is one very useful trick that simply allows you to sense, precisely, the \emph{here} and \emph{now}.
	
	You always know where and when you are, and which way you are facing.
	You can't get lost; you always know the distance and direction to any place you've been before, although not necessarily the best way to get there.
	You know what time it is, and how long you've been unconscious whenever you wake up.
	You even know where and when you were, or will be, at the time you are looking into with a \featref{hindsight} or \featref{foresight} {\vision}.
	
	Note that, like most magic outside \discref{projection}, this does not work while you are in the {\mentalrealm}.
}

\feat{Taglock Identification}{divination-taglock-identify}{10}{
	\noprereq
}{
	You can touch a \materialref{taglock} and detect who it originates from.
	If you have met the target, you can identify them infallibly.
	
	If you have never met the target, you must make a \testtype{heed}{divination} {\test}, with higher results giving more information about the target.
	You can only get general information about the target this way, such as height, build, sex, appearance, and occupation.
	You can't get any information about their location, or even whether they are still alive.
}

\feat{Taglock Tracing}{divination-taglock-location}{15}{
	\featref{divination-taglock-identify},
	\featref{divination-location}
}{
	When you touch a \materialref{taglock}, you can find the person or creature it originates from.
	You know their location.
	This comes in the form of distance and direction, allowing you to easily navigate towards them.
	If they are moving, you can feel their position changing as they do.
	
	However, matching where they are to a place that you know requires you to also know the location of that place.
	For example, knowing that they are in the castle requires you to know the location of the castle, and match the two up to realise that's the location they're in.
}

\feat{Seen in the Dregs}{divination-dregs}{10}{
	\featref{divination-taglock-identify}
}{
	To a \practitioner{divination}, the dregs in the bottom of a cup can reveal much about those who drank from it.
	By inspecting the arrangement of the leaves in the bottom of a cup of tea or the sediments in the bottom of a cup of wine, you may use it the cup as a \materialref{taglock} for the purposes of \discref{divination} magic.
	The \materialref{taglock} connects to everyone who drank the tea or wine since the cup was last filled.
	
	By itself, this is of limited use---it's often easier to find a normal \materialref{taglock} than a cup a person drank from.
	This is most useful in that it allows a single \materialref{taglock} to connect to multiple people: everyone who drank from the cup as long as it was not refilled between each sip.
	
	If it is relevant, you may choose whether magic using the \materialref{taglock} targets any one of the people who drank from it, or all of them simultaneously.
	For example, if you use \featref{portent-visit} with \featref{portent-muse-taglock}, you may choose to see a {\vision} of the next time any one the drinkers visits your location, or the next time all the drinkers visit simultaneously.
}

\feat{Scrying}{scrying}{10}{
	\noprereq
}{
	You can use a \materialref{crystal-ball} to scry.
	You can scry on any location within 1 kilometre, but must be able to estimate distance and direction the place you are scrying.
	This is easy enough for any place you've taken a simple route to or from, but it might be hard to scry on the middle of a maze using this.
	\capital{\featref{divination-location}} allows you to perfectly place any location you have been, and \featref{divination-taglock-location} lets you place a person.
	
	Scrying essentially forms a sensor, hanging in the air at the target location---although the ``sensor'' is invisible, intangible, and doesn't actually exist in any real sense.
	While scrying, you can move the sensor at a strolling pace, in all three dimensions and unimpeded by walls.
	It must stay within your 1 kilometre scrying radius.
	
	It takes about a minute of concentration on the \materialref{crystal-ball} for the image to form.
	Anyone looking into the ball sees out from the sensor, and can look around by looking into the ball at different angles.
	However, you cannot see anything more than a dozen metres from the sensor; the image becomes too distorted.
	You only get vision; no other senses.
	However, you still benefit from anything that enhances your vision, such as \featref{darkvision}.
	
	Scrying requires continuous concentration---you must remain within a metre of the \materialref{crystal-ball}, and can't manage any more significant actions than talking or idly knitting.
	You may only maintain one scrying sensor at a time.

	You can, and should, leave them in your head for this.

	However, you still need to be near the \materialref{crystal-ball} to form the image in the first place, or to move the sensor.

	Seeing the future is more difficult than seeing the past, but you've got it figured out.
	The ritual to begin a {\vision} of the future requires 15 minutes of concentration, while remaining in one place.
	The {\vision} follows the normal rules for {\foretelling}; the world you see is the world as it would have been if you did not have this {\vision}.
	
	You select a time in the future---no more than a day ahead---to view.
	You must specify a time, for example, 30 minutes or 8 hours ahead; finding a specific event requires dead reckoning.
	The {\vision} is unstable and brief, it covers the period of time only 1 minute forward from time you specified, and ends when you reach the end of this time.

	Sometimes, you just can't arrive at the scene of the crime for quite a while after it happened, and don't have the time to waste sending your eyes that far back.
	Thankfully, you've learned to pick up the pace.
	
	You may accelerate your {\visions}, up to 20 times the speed.
	This lets you view an hour in just three minutes, or most of a day in an hour.
	You can switch between rapid speed and normal speed at will, to watch the interesting bits and skip the useless parts.
	
	This goes in the normal direction for the {\vision}: forward for \featref{foresight} and backwards for \featref{hindsight}.
	It is more useful for \featref{hindsight}, of course, as it allows you to go further back.
	If you also have \featref{vision-bidirectional}, you can go up to this speed forwards or backwards, though never outside of the {\visionpossessive} allotted time.

	You may accelerate your {\visions} to ludicrous speed.

\feat{Freeze Frame}{vision-pause}{10}{

	You may pause your {\visions}, freezing everything in place so that you can look around leisurely.
	You may change at will between watching the {\vision} normally and paused, but ending the {\vision} still jumps you back the present.
	You may also just slow it down, watching things in slow-motion, although still in the same direction.
	
	If you have \featref{hindsight}, you may initiate and immediately pause it to freeze-frame the present moment.
	Note that time will still continue around you; only your perception is frozen.
	
	The duration of \featref{foresight} {\visions} is limited by the time you \emph{see}, rather than time that passes for you.
	So you may spend several hours examining a paused {\vision}, even if you cannot see anything that occurs more than 1 minute after the {\vision} starts.
	You have a moment's warning when the {\vision} is about to expire, allowing you to pause to examine the very end of the {\vision}, before it fades.

	Much as you may pause your {\visions}, you can play them the other way.
	This makes interpreting speech from \featref{hindsight} much easier, among other things.
	
	You may change at will between watching your {\visions} forwards, backwards, or pausing them, going forwards or backwards at any speed up to normal speed.
	You must always stay within the {\visionpossessive} allotted time, however.
	The same as with \featref{vision-pause}, you have a moment's warning when the allotted time is about to expire, allowing you to turn and watch back the other way.

	You may use \featref{hindsight} or \featref{foresight}---assuming you have them---on your \featref{scrying} images, making them watch backwards in time, or watch some time in the future.
	Starting \featref{foresight} on a scrying surface requires you to concentrate on the scrying surface for as long as it would normally take you to begin \featref{foresight}.
	
	If you also have \featref{scrying-unattended}, you can even leave the image running using either of them.
	However, changing the speed or pausing it (if you have feats to do so), requires you to be near the scrying surface, just like moving the sensor.
	\capital{\featref{foresight}} will still expire at the usual time.

\feat{Haruspex}{portent-entrails}{10}{
	\featref{foresight}

	You may inspect spilled entrails as a {\portent} to foretell great violence.
	The entrails must come from a creature at least the size of a cat, and you must spill them fresh from the creature's body as part of beginning \featref{foresight}.
	If you use this {\portent}, then instead of specifying a time for the resulting {\vision}, you see a moment of violence.
	
	This shows the most violent moment within the time and location searched, as determined by the GM.
	The {\vision} begins around the start of the violence, but is always positioned such that it encompasses the most violent part.

	You may watch the behaviour of a bird as a {\portent} to foretell sorrow.
	The bird must be {\wild}, and behaving naturally, not a familiar or captured bird.

	\emph{One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy. Five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told.}
	While one bird foretells sorrow for you, you may use many birds to bring sorrow upon another.
	
	This requires you to watch the behaviour of many birds---at least seven---as a {\portent}.
	Just like \featref{portent-birds}, these must be {\wild} birds.
	Additionally, you must watch the behaviour of a {\muse}.
	
	This works just like \featref{portent-birds}, except that instead of seeing an event that would upset you, you see the event that the {\muse} would least like you to see---an event they would want to hide from you.
	This gives the {\muse} no awareness of the event to come, or even that you have used this on them at all.
	
	You can still use \featref{portent-birds} instead of this, even if multiple birds are present; it is simple to focus on just one of them.
}

\feat{Portents of Intersection}{portent-visit}{15}{
	\featref{foresight}
}{
	By casting sticks and studying their intersections, you may predict future visits and meetings.
	To do so, you must cast at least a dozen straight sticks on the ground as you begin \featref{foresight}, and study them as a {\portent}.
	Additionally, you must watch the behaviour of a {\muse}.
	You may use yourself as the {\muse}.
	
	If you use this {\portent}, you see a {\vision} of the next time the {\muse} will visit the location of your {\vision}.
	Used in combination with \featref{portent-aim-self} or \featref{portent-aim-taglock}, this sees not the next time they visit a location, but the next time they meet the person in question.
	
	In most cases---unless you're using \featref{scrying} to watch someone in a different location or \featref{vision-scrying} to see a {\vision} of a different location---the {\muse} will already be in the location of the {\vision}.
	In this case, the {\vision} will not just be of the present time: it will wait until the {\muse} has left and returned.
}

\feat{Tarot}{portent-chance}{25}{
	\skillref[2]{divination},
	\featref{foresight}
}{
	Simply guessing at the time you want to foresee is rather inaccurate, and likely to leave you with a {\vision} of a whole lot of nothing.
	By laying out \materialrefplural{tarot} as a {\portent}, you may try to aim your {\vision} at a specific event.
	You must specify the event you are looking for, in as much detail as you can.
	For example, you might look for ``when our coven comes back out of this cave'', ``the next time someone enters this pub'', or ``the next time I snap my fingers''.
	
	\capital{\materialrefplural{tarot}} are an instrument of chance, and using this feat \emph{always} requires a {\test}.
	The GM sets the {\tn}, based on the specificity of the event you are looking for.
	The more you can specify about it---the more accurately you can visualise it---the easier the {\test} is.
	For example, ``the next time I snap my fingers'' specifies very little about most of the scene, while ``when our coven comes back out of this cave'' specifies several people, and what they are doing.
	The {\testpossessive} difficulty, as usual, is raised further by rushing your magic, or using substandard materials.
	
	If you fail the {\test}, then you receive a false result.
	The GM may show you an entirely false {\vision} of the specified event occurring, or may falsely inform you that the event won't happen and show you no {\vision} at all.
	The GM should not inform you of whether you succeeded or failed the {\test}.

	Instead of searching for an event in the place your scrying sensor is currently positioned, the {\portent} searches for an event that occurs wherever \emph{you} are in the future.
	For example, if you used this with \featref{portent-entrails}, it would focus on the most violent event that occurs to you within the time period you search.
	When your {\vision} starts, the scrying sensor is automatically refocused to the location of the event; that is, your location at the time of the event.
