\discipline{Divination}{divination}{Seer}{Seers}

\dropcapdiscref{divination} is the art of seeing, hearing, and otherwise sensing in ways that are not normally possible.
Many witches consider it to be a very narrow and limited discipline.
In many ways, they are right.
It certainly lacks the versatility of \discref{willing}.
In fact, it lacks \discrefpossessive{willing} ability to affect the world at all.

Rather, \practitioners{divination}---as the practitioners of \discref{divination} are called---tend to rely on enhanced knowledge and awareness.
It's all very well, they say, having the power to crush a man beneath a ton of rock, but which man to crush?
Was he the one who did the crime?
And where's he run off to now?
With {\foretelling}, it may be possible to stop him before he even commits the crime.
After all, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and a single arrow can change the world if you know just where to put it.

Despite its seemingly narrow focus, \discref{divination} still covers a fairly wide gamut of abilities.
The simplest just enhance an existing sense, allowing a witch to see in the dark, for example.
Some, such as \featref{divination-location}, grant an entirely new sense.
Perhaps the most interesting, however, are \featref{scrying}, \featref{hindsight}, and \featref{foresight}.
These allow the witch to see distant locations, the past, and even the future.

In terms of the necessary equipment, \discref{divination} sits between the extremes of \discref{willing} and \discref{ritual-magic}.
Much of it, particularly simple enhancements to a witch's senses, requires nothing beyond a witch's eyes or ears, and sometimes not even those.
In fact, many of these abilities require essentially no ongoing effort from the witch; once she knows the trick of it, it's as easy as opening her eyes.
Some \discref{divination}, however---particularly sensing distant locations---requires a lot more concentration and equipment.
\capital{\featref{scrying}} requires a surface to look through, and several abilities require an object to focus upon, to find the right time or location to sense.

\capital{\attref{heed}} is the most important attribute in \discref{divination}.
The discipline is entirely about extending one's awareness, and a witch who is blind to her own surroundings in the first place is going to have a hard time looking any further afield.

\section{Foretelling}
\seclabel{foretelling}

For many witches, telling the future is the most enticing part of \discref{divination}.
It is, however, the trickiest.

In truth, nobody has ever managed to see their own future.
To know one's own fate, but to do \emph{nothing} to avoid it, is a level of self-discipline beyond any \practitioner{divination} the world has yet seen.
And without that self-discipline, the future is simply inscrutable---it seems almost to be defending itself against change.

But witches wouldn't be witches if they hadn't found a way to cheat.
You can't see your own future, but you can see the next closest thing.
So foretelling, such as it is practised, is a matter of forking the stream of time, of tossing a rock into the flow and sending it thundering down two different channels.
There is a moment in every foretelling ritual, or spell, where the \practitioner{divination} goes two ways.
On one branch, she completes the ritual.
On the other, she stops abruptly halfway through, stands up, and goes about her life none the wiser.
It is the world of the second \practitioner{divination} that the first \practitioner{divination} sees.

Most \practitioners{divination} treat this as a metaphor, of course.
They've never \emph{actually} abandoned the ritual halfway through, no matter how many times they've seen themselves do it.
But some do wonder if those copies of themselves exist out there somewhere, even the ones they've seen die.

\subsection{The World Foretold}

All in all, a \practitioner{divination} performing foretelling sees visions of the world as it would turn out if she did not perform this foretelling.
So long as she does not interfere, she may assume that things will proceed, for the most part, the same.
But, as she changes more things, the worlds will diverge further, until her predictions become useless.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that sitting still in a dark room, doing nothing, doesn't mean a \practitioner{divination} is not interfering.
In the world where she performed no divination, the one she has peered in on, she likely acted, going out and doing whatever she normally did.
By sitting still in this world, she leaves out the results of those actions, probably rendering her predictions inaccurate quite quickly.

As such, the best way to keep predictions accurate for as long as possible is to act as though she never made them in the first place, going about as though she were blind to the future.
It will never work indefinitely, but she might be able to keep it up for a while.

\subsection{Foretelling \& the Metagame}

Telling the future is tricky not only for a witch, in character, but also for the GM running the game.
Giving good visions requires the GM to predict how events would play out, assuming the \practitioner{divination} had no foreknowledge.
This requires more planning than some GMs might want to do.

Furthermore, it often requires predicting how the player's characters would act, which can cause problems.
The GM is free to ask the players themselves, if that won't give away any plot details that the vision itself won't.
It can even be fun to play out the world where the \practitioner{divination} did not perform her foretelling, before jumping back to the point of the foretelling with the \practitionerpossessive{divination} new knowledge and playing again from there.
That can grow tedious, of course---it should be used sparingly, and with the agreement of everyone at the table.

Most importantly, both the players and the GM should be understanding that telling the future is tricky business.
Everyone should be willing to forgive mistakes, and to try and resolve everything coherently.
And if everything is just too much, the GM can request that players simply avoid the more troublesome feats.
Even then, feats such as \featref{divination-initiative} and \featref{divination-dodge} allow for witches who can see the future without requiring the GM to invent visions.

\subsection{Foretelling as a Plot Device}

Prophecies and visions are an ancient staple of myths and legends, as well as contemporary literature.
GMs should feel free to use foretelling as a device in creating plots for the game.
This may use the visions provided by a player character's feats, other omens, or visions imparted upon a \practitioner{divination}, or a non-player \practitioner{divination}.

One aspect to play with as part of a plot is the assumption that no \practitioner{divination} can see their own future.
Just because no \practitioner{divination} has had the self-discipline to manage it yet, doesn't mean that it is impossible.
Any plot violating this assumption must be very carefully executed, to avoid taking agency away from the players, but can be very effective if it is done well.
Just remember that witches are notorious cheats---even predestined events are only fixed to the extent that they've been seen, and can always be staged.

\section{Visions of the Past and Future}
\seclabel{visions}

The counterpart to seeing the future, {\foretelling}, is seeing the past; often called hindsight.
This carries some important difference to {\foretelling}.
For one thing; it's easier.
The past has already happened; it's right there for looking at.
Secondly, it's always accurate.
Looking at the future inevitably changes it, so that what you see isn't quite what will wind up happening.
Looking at the past, however, does nothing to change it.
The other side of this, of course, is that it's too late to change it, even if you want to.

Despite the differences, however, {\visions} of the past and the future have a lot in common.
This section lays out the mechanics of such {\visions}, as used by the \featref{hindsight} and \featref{foresight} feats.

Firstly, the feat that grants you the {\vision} defines the period of time that the {\vision} covers.
For \featref{hindsight}, this period of time is always the entire past, from the present moment, as far back as you can reach.
\capital{\featref{foresight}}, however, is less stable.
Its {\visions} begin at a particular time---some time in the future---and run for a fixed length of time after that.
You can end them early, but you can never run them beyond that time.

For a novice witch, time within a {\vision} simply plays from one end to the other, at normal speed.
With \featref{foresight}, time plays forward, from the beginning of the {\vision} to the end.
With \featref{hindsight}, time plays backwards, from the present moment until the witch stops maintaining the {\vision}.
More experienced witches will learn to break these rules, of course.

While in a {\vision}, you see, hear, and otherwise sense around the current location of your body.
However, your senses detect what was, or will be, happening at the time you are looking in on.
For example, with \featref{hindsight}, you could enter a room, then look backwards to see what happened in a room before you entered it.

\capital{\visions} affect all senses except touch.
You see, hear, smell, and taste the time you are looking in on.
You benefit from any enhancements to these senses, such as \featref{darkvision}, and even from entirely new senses, such as those granted by \featref{divination-location}, \featref{divination-taglock-location}, or \featref{death-detection}.
You cannot use {\visions} within the {\mentalrealm}---or even sense the {\mentalrealm} at all---without the feat \featref{vision-projection}.

Your sense of touch, however, remains in the present time.
You cannot touch anything from the past or future, and people in these times can even walk straight through you---quite a disturbing experience.
A {\vision} renders you blind, deaf, and otherwise insensate to your current surroundings; only touch keeps you connected to the present.
Someone trying to bring you out of a {\vision} is advised to tap you on the shoulder; you won't sense anything but a touch.

You may end a {\vision} at any time you choose, at which point your senses immediately snap back to the present.
The {\vision} also ends if you fall asleep, fall unconscious, or, in the case of \featref{foresight}, you reach the end of its allotted period of time.

You may act normally during a {\vision}; knitting, talking, even pacing.
You cannot sense what you're doing except through touch, which can make things quite difficult.
Walls don't tend to move too much, however---as long as you are looking at the immediate past or future---so you can hopefully avoid walking into those.

Although you can move about during a {\vision}, a novice cannot hold a {\vision} together if they move too far from where they began it.
The {\vision} breaks down and ends if you move too far from where you began it; you can manage a couple of metres without trouble, or more with a {\test}.
\capital{\featref{vision-move}} lifts this limitation.

The limitation of only being able to see the area around where you are currently standing is quite a major one, but there are a couple of things you can do to lift it, making use of \featref{scrying}.
While in a {\vision}, you can see any scrying images that existed in the time and place you are looking at.
With \featref{foresight} in particular, you might be able to look at yourself scrying in the future.
This is far harder to arrange with \featref{hindsight}, however, and does not work at all with \featref{scrying-eyes}.
The more reliable solution is to use the feat \featref{vision-scrying}.

\section{Feats}

\feat{Dimvision}{darkvision}{15}{
	\noprereq
}{
	Your eyes, magically assisted, can pick up the barest traces of light.
	You suffer no penalties in low-light conditions, though you are as blind as anyone in complete darkness.

\feat{Unclouded Vision}{xray-vision}{10}{
	\skillref[1]{divination},

	Translucent substances, such as fog, murky water, or dust storms, do not obscure or distort your vision.
	Intermediate cases, such as a leafy canopy or dense cobwebs, can be seen through with a \testtype{heed}{divination} {\test}.
}

\feat{Blindsight}{blindsight}{15}{
	\skillref[2]{divination},
	\featref{darkvision-2}
}{
	You no longer need to use your eyes to see.
	You cannot be blinded, or have your vision impaired.
	
	This covers mundane afflictions, such as grit in your eyes, or having your eyes gouged out, as well as effects such as a \featref{smell-potion}, or being transformed into a blind animal.
	Other divination feats, however, such as \featref{scrying-eyes}, blind you at deeper level.
	This offers you no protection against them.
	Furthermore, this feat offers no immunity to the \featref{headology-remove-sense} feat, although knowing that you cannot be blinded makes it much harder to convince you that you have been.
	
	Likewise, this doesn't make you immune to a blindfold, or a bag over your head.
	You're still seeing out from your eyes, or your eye sockets if those are gone.
}

\feat{Eyes in the Back of Your Head}{360-vision}{15}{
	\skillref[1]{divination}
}{
	You can see behind you.
	In fact you can see all around yourself; 360 degrees, plus up and down.
	This makes you far harder to sneak up on, and lets you observe someone without looking in their direction.
	The GM may give a bonus to \skillref{perception} {\tests} relying on spotting something that you might not be looking at.
	
	This feat does not literally give you any extra eyes, and only works as long as you can see normally.
	However, it also works when looking through a \featref{scrying} surface, allowing you to see out in all directions from the sensor.
}

\feat{Perfect Positioning}{divination-location}{10}{
	\noprereq
}{
	While much of \discref{divination} deals in sensing the future, the past, or distant locations, there is one very useful trick that simply allows you to sense, precisely, the \emph{here} and \emph{now}.
	
	You always know where and when you are, and which way you are facing.
	You can't get lost; you always know the distance and direction to any place you've been before, although not necessarily the best way to get there.
	You know what time it is, and how long you've been unconscious whenever you wake up.
	You even know where and when you were, or will be, at the time you are looking into with a \featref{hindsight} or \featref{foresight} {\vision}.
	
	Note that, like most magic outside \discref{projection}, this does not work while you are in the {\mentalrealm}.
}

\feat{Taglock Identification}{divination-taglock-identify}{10}{
	\noprereq
}{
	You can touch a \materialref{taglock} and detect who it originates from.
	If you have met the target, you can identify them infallibly.
	
	If you have never met the target, you must make a \testtype{heed}{divination} {\test}, with higher results giving more information about the target.
	You can only get general information about the target this way, such as height, build, sex, appearance, and occupation.
	You can't get any information about their location, or even whether they are still alive.
}

\feat{Taglock Tracing}{divination-taglock-location}{15}{
	\featref{divination-taglock-identify},
	\featref{divination-location}
}{
	When you touch a \materialref{taglock}, you can find the person or creature it originates from.
	You know their location.
	This comes in the form of distance and direction, allowing you to easily navigate towards them.
	If they are moving, you can feel their position changing as they do.
	
	However, matching where they are to a place that you know requires you to also know the location of that place.
	For example, knowing that they are in the castle requires you to know the location of the castle, and match the two up to realise that's the location they're in.
}

\feat{Scrying}{scrying}{10}{
	\noprereq
}{
	You can use a \materialref{crystal-ball} to scry.
	You can scry on any location within 1 kilometre, but must be able to estimate distance and direction the place you are scrying.
	This is easy enough for any place you've taken a simple route to or from, but it might be hard to scry on the middle of a maze using this.
	\capital{\featref{divination-location}} allows you to perfectly place any location you have been, and \featref{divination-taglock-location} lets you place a person.
	
	Scrying essentially forms a sensor, hanging in the air at the target location---although the ``sensor'' is invisible, intangible, and doesn't actually exist in any real sense.
	While scrying, you can move the sensor at a strolling pace, in all three dimensions and unimpeded by walls.
	It must stay within your 1 kilometre scrying radius.
	
	It takes about a minute of concentration on the \materialref{crystal-ball} for the image to form.
	Anyone looking into the ball sees out from the sensor, and can look around by looking into the ball at different angles.
	However, you cannot see anything more than a dozen metres from the sensor; the image becomes too distorted.
	You only get vision; no other senses.
	However, you still benefit from anything that enhances your vision, such as \featref{darkvision}.
	
	Scrying requires continuous concentration---you must remain within a metre of the \materialref{crystal-ball}, and can't manage any more significant actions than talking or idly knitting.
	You may only maintain one scrying sensor at a time.
}

\feat{Mirror Scrying}{scrying-mirror}{15}{

	You may use a mirror instead of a \materialref{crystal-ball} for \featref{scrying}.

}

\feat{Eyeball Scrying}{scrying-eyes}{15}{
	\skillref[2]{divination},

	By a sufficient stretch of the imagination, an eyeball is nearly a \materialref{crystal-ball}.
	It takes a little trick to look out from the inside of them, rather than in from the outside, but you've made it work.
	
	You can use \featref{scrying} without a \materialref{crystal-ball} or mirror, by using your eyeballs.
	You can, and should, leave them in your head for this.
	This works only for you; other people cannot see in on your scrying.
	
	You are blinded to your own surroundings while using your eyes in this way.
	Additionally, unless you also have \featref{scrying-unattended}, you must keep most of your concentration on the scrying, and cannot do much more than stroll around a bit.

	You've learned to counteract the distortion caused by your scrying apparatus.

	You may see just as well as if you were at the location of the sensor yourself.
	
	With a sufficiently aerial view, you might even see for several kilometres, while keeping the sensor within 1 kilometre.
	However, you have no more than your usual ability to resolve detail at that range.

	However, you still need to be near the \materialref{crystal-ball} to form the image in the first place, or to move the sensor.
	Forming the image requires concentration, but moving it is as easy as glancing around.
	If you have \featref{scrying-speed}, refocusing entirely is still an {\action}.
	
	You can still only maintain one instance of scrying at a time.
	The image dissolves if you begin a new instance of scrying, and you can also dispel it at any time you choose.
	The image also dissolves if you die.
	
	You can use this with a mirror as well as a \materialref{crystal-ball} if you have \featref{scrying-mirror}, and with your own eyes if you have \featref{scrying-eyes}.
	In this latter case, other people still cannot look in on your scrying, but it allows you to act normally while scrying.

	You may use \featref{hindsight} or \featref{foresight}---assuming you have them---on your \featref{scrying} images, making them watch backwards in time, or watch some time in the future.
	Starting \featref{foresight} on a scrying surface requires you to concentrate on the scrying surface for as long as it would normally take you to begin \featref{foresight}.
	
	If you also have \featref{scrying-unattended}, you can even leave the image running using either of them.
	However, changing the speed or pausing it (if you have feats to do so), requires you to be near the scrying surface, just like moving the sensor.
	\capital{\featref{foresight}} will still expire at the usual time.

\feat{Haruspex}{foresight-entrails}{10}{
	\featref{foresight}
}{
	By spilling the entrails of a creature at least the size of a cat, you can foretell great violence.
	You must spill these entrails, fresh from the creature's body, as part of beginning \featref{foresight}.
	If you do so, then instead of specifying a time for the resulting {\vision}, you see a moment of violence.
	
	This searches for the most violent moment within the time \featref{foresight} would normally allow you to view, as determined by the GM.
	The {\vision} begins around the start of the violence, but is always positioned such that it encompasses the most violent part.
	You may search a shorter time than you are able to, if you wish.
	For example, you may choose to look only for the most violent moment within the next hour.
	
	This only searches for violence in your immediate surroundings---such that you would be able to sense it in the {\vision} from where you stand now.
	In combination with \featref{vision-scrying}, it searches around the current location of the scrying sensor.

\feat{One for Sorrow}{foresight-birds}{15}{
	\skillref[1]{divination},
	\featref{foresight-entrails}
}{
	By watching the behaviour of a bird as you begin \featref{foresight}, you foretell sorrow.
	The bird must be {\wild}, and behaving naturally, not a familiar or captured bird.
	If you do so, then instead of specifying a time, you see a {\vision} of the event which would most upset you---typically the event you most want to avert.
	
	Just like \featref{foresight-entrails}, this searches your current location---or the current location of the scrying sensor---within the time \featref{foresight} would normally allow you to view, and you may shorten the time it searches if you wish.

	\featref{foresight-birds}
}{
	\emph{One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy. Five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told.}
	While one bird foretells sorrow for you, you may use many birds to bring sorrow upon another.
	
	This requires you to watch the behaviour of many birds---at least seven---while you begin \featref{foresight}.
	Just like \featref{foresight-birds}, these must be {\wild} birds.
	Additionally, you must watch the behaviour of a person or other creature: the target.
	
	This works just like \featref{foresight-birds}, except that instead of seeing an event that would upset you, you see the event that the target would least like you to see---an event they would want to hide from you.
	This gives the target no awareness of the event to come, or even that you have used this on them at all.
	
	You can still use \featref{foresight-birds} instead of this, even if multiple birds are present; it is simple to focus on just one of them.

\feat{Tarot}{foresight-chance}{25}{
	\skillref[2]{divination},
	\featref{foresight}
}{
	Simply guessing at the time you want to foresee is rather inaccurate, and likely to leave you with a {\vision} of a whole lot of nothing.
	By laying out \materialrefplural{tarot} while you begin \featref{foresight}, you may try to aim your {\vision} at a specific event.
	
	You must specify the event you are looking for, in as much detail as you can.
	For example, you might look for ``when our coven comes back out of this cave'', ``the next time someone enters this pub'', or ``the next time I snap my fingers''.
	The event you specify must be something you would be able to sense in the {\vision}, either from where you stand now, or---in combination with \featref{vision-scrying}---from the current location of the scrying sensor.
	
	\capital{\materialrefplural{tarot}} are an instrument of chance, and using this feat \emph{always} requires a {\test}.
	The GM sets the {\tn}, based on the specificity of the event you are looking for.
	The more you can specify about it---the more accurately you can visualise it---the easier the {\test} is.
	For example, ``the next time I snap my fingers'' specifies very little about most of the scene, while ``when our coven comes back out of this cave'' specifies several people, and what they are doing.
	The {\testpossessive} difficulty, as usual, is raised further by rushing your magic, or using substandard materials.
	
	If you succeed on the {\test}, and the event you specified occurs within the time \featref{foresight} would normally allow you to view, then you receive a {\vision} of the event, of the usual length.
	If you fail the {\test}, or if the event would not occur where you could sense it within the time you can view, then you receive a {\vision} of a random point within the time you searched.
	You have no indication of which has occurred, beyond whether you see the event within the {\vision}.
	If you wish, you can shorten the period of time you are searching; for example, you can look for it only within the next hour.

}{
	Rather than using omens to search the future of the place you currently stand, you can use them to search your own future.
	To do this, you must be using \featref{vision-scrying} to begin \featref{foresight} through a scrying surface, and you must be using a feat such as \featref{foresight-entrails}, \featref{foresight-birds}, or \featref{foresight-chance} to select a time for your {\vision}.
	
	Instead of searching for an event in the place your scrying sensor is currently positioned, this searches for an event that occurs wherever \emph{you} are in the future.
	When your {\vision} starts, the scrying sensor is automatically refocused to the location of the event; that is, your location at the time of the event.
	This will never focus upon an event that happens outside your scrying range.
	
	For example, if you used this with \featref{foresight-entrails}, it would focus on the most violent event that occurs to you within the time period you search.
	If you use this with \featref{foresight-chance}, and fail, it still focuses on your position at the random time you see.

	Using a \materialref{taglock}, you may seek {\visions} of what is to befall another person.
	When you use \featref{foresight-aim-self}, you may select a person or creature for whom you have a \materialref{taglock}, rather than yourself.
	This searches for events in their vicinity, wherever they are in the future, and focuses the scrying sensor upon them.
