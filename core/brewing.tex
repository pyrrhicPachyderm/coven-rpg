\discipline{Brewing}{brewing}{Brewer}{Brewers}

\dropcapdiscref{brewing} may well be the least magical of witchcraft's disciplines.
In fact, it is not even restricted to witches.
Many wise folk can cook up a remedy for the most common ailments.
And almost every village has someone to brew their hops into beer.

As such, the feats in this discipline are not necessary for common brewing; they represent only those brews that require some trick, skill, or guarded piece of knowledge.
Anyone, even those without ranks in the \skillref{brewing} skill, may attempt to create more common brews.
Some, such as alcohol, are relatively simple.
A {\test} may determine the quality of the result, but almost anyone can create \emph{something} appropriate.

Remedies for diseases and ailments are a little more complicated.
That's not to say that it takes much skill to boil up a few strips of willow bark, but half of the common knowledge of folk medicine is ungrounded superstition.
It requires a \testtype{ken}{brewing} {\test} to create an appropriate remedy for most ailments, with the {\tn} of the {\test} determined by the rarity and severity of the ailment.
This normally requires access to a wide array of \materialrefplural{herb} and a boiling cauldron; the {\tn} might be increased as normal by trying to make do with inadequate materials.

For particularly simple remedies---such as helping a person to sleep, or easing an ache---it may suffice to use the raw \materialref{herb}, without any \discref{brewing}.
In this case, a \testtype{ken}{botany} {\test} might suffice.

\section{Brew-Toting}

A \practitioner{brewing} is not just a witch who can brew potions, but also a witch who tends to carry them.
It is assumed that a \practitioner{brewing} carries at least one dose of each potion she knows how to make; normally several doses of each.
Unless she begins providing potions to groups much larger than her coven, or keeping people dosed on a particular potion for hours on end, she should have plenty of doses.
If she does do this, however, the GM is welcome to declare that she runs out and has to brew some more.

This assumes, however, that she has ready access to all the ingredients required to brew her potions.
In most cases, this simply means that the witch has access to her {\garden}, and sufficient \skillref{botany} skill that her {\garden} contains the required \materialrefplural{herb}.
If she doesn't have ready access to the required ingredients, she will either have to gain access somehow, or improvise replacements.
In either case, the GM is free to have these endeavours role-played, and require {\tests} for them.

\section{Brews for Everyone}

Most \practitioners{brewing} sample their own fare.
But the main benefit of \discref{brewing} comes from sharing one's potions.
The other members of your coven; their familiars, and yours; friendly village folk; even an \featref{animal-companion}; everyone can benefit from your brews---except golems and the undead.

As such, many \practitioners{brewing} fall into something of a supportive role within their coven.
So don't be afraid to share your potions, to allow everyone to do what they do even better.

This doesn't have to come at the cost of doing your own thing, however.
You can easily brew a dose or two of every potion for every member of your coven, and can even make the other witches carry their own doses.
The brunt of your \discref{brewing} work will be done during downtime, leaving you plenty of time to get involved when you're out and about.

\section{Creation and Application}

The \skillref{brewing} skill and \discref{brewing} discipline don't just cover potions brewed in a cauldron.
Potions, poultices, poisons, tinctures, salves, ointments, even beer, mead, wine and spirits.
Witches have many ways of turning \materialrefplural{herb}, and even other ingredients, into more useful forms.

Each feat that allows a witch to prepare such a mixture lists the method of preparation and delivery.
The rules of such methods are presented below.

\subsection{Brewing and Chewing}

Different methods of preparation require different equipment, and take different periods of time.

\mixcreation{Cauldron}{cauldron}{
	Most potions are brewed in cauldrons, filled with water and brought to boil.
	This requires, obviously, a cauldron, as well as a fire to heat it.
	A smaller kettle might do in a pinch, but requires a {\test}.
	A full cauldron will typically yield several doses.
	Brewing in a cauldron requires around 15 minutes to bring the water to the boil, and another minute to mix the potion.
}

\mixcreation{Poultice}{poultice}{
	A poultice doesn't need to be brewed at all; the ingredients are simply chewed into a paste.
	Some of the more dangerous poultices should definitely be ground with a mortar and pestle, however, rather than allowed anywhere near the mouth.
	Creating a poultice requires less than a minute.
}

\mixcreation{Still}{still}{
	Some potions, or spirits, need to be distilled.
	This requires quite a lot of dedicated equipment, a carefully maintained heat source, and several hours.
}

\subsection{Method of Delivery}

Although most potions are drunk, there are many ways to get a mixture into a person's body.
Some faster, some slower, and some far easier to inflict on an unwilling victim.

\mixdelivery{Drink}{drink}{
	A \mixdeliveryref{drink} is about half a litre of liquid that must be drunk to take effect.
	It can be quaffed as an {\action}, and takes effect after 1 {\round}, unless specified otherwise.
}

\mixdelivery{Spike}{spike}{
	A \mixdeliveryref{spike} is a much smaller quantity of liquid than a \mixdeliveryref{drink}, little enough that it could be slipped into a glass of wine without being obvious.
	It can be drunk willingly, but typically isn't.
	It takes effect after 1 {\round}, unless specified otherwise.
	
	In a glass of wine or a cup of water, one dose will normally go unnoticed until it is too late.
	A second dose causes a noticeable change in taste, scent, or colour, which will typically be noticed unless the drinker isn't paying much attention.
	Larger and stronger drinks can conceal more doses, however.
}

\mixdelivery{Topical}{topical}{
	A \mixdeliveryref{topical} mixture is applied to the skin.
	It typically requires more than an {\action} to smear it on, or bind a wad in place.
	It generally only takes effect after a few minutes, but can kick in a little faster if applied to a wound or a mucous membrane.
	Some need to be applied to the correct part of the body.
	For example, if it is to treat a wound, it should be applied to the wound, and if it is to enhance the eyesight, it should be applied to the eyes.
}

\mixdelivery{Snuff}{snuff}{
	These mixtures are boiled or ground down to a powder, which must be inhaled into the nostrils.
	They can be taken as an {\action}, and take effect immediately.
	Giving them to someone unwilling requires forcing them to inhale in some fashion, but it can usually be achieved if you have the target at your mercy for a minute or more.
}

\mixdelivery{Injury}{injury}{
	These mixtures, typically harmful ones, must be delivered into the bloodstream via an injury.
	The most expedient way to do this is to smear it on an arrow, a \weaponref{blowgun} dart, or an edged weapon, requiring an {\action}.
	It's good for one cut, but otherwise remains on the weapon until rubbed off or washed away.
	Beware rain.
	It takes effect immediately, unless specified otherwise.
}

%TODO: Gaseous? Needs to be stored in an air-tight bottle?
%TODO: Incense? Needs to be burned, evaporated?

\subsection{Time to Effect}

Mixtures applied by different methods typically require different lengths of time to take effect, as specified above.
Some mixtures require more or less time to take effect, as specified in their descriptions.
If quaffed on a creature's {\turn}, a mixture that takes effect after 1 {\round} comes into play at the start of their {\turn} in the next {\round}.

The GM may allow a character to make \attref{might} {\tests} to stave off the effects of an unwanted mixture.
This might extend the time to effect by two or three times, but should not allow them to avoid the effect entirely, except in the most exceptional cases.

\subsection{Vomiting}

For ingested mixtures (a \mixdeliveryref{drink} or \mixdeliveryref{spike}), vomiting before it takes effect can massively ease this \attref{might} {\test}, and even allow avoiding the effect entirely.
Ingesting an emetic herb, such as \herb{veratrum or the toadstool ``emetic russula''}{2}, serves to induce vomiting.
However, these herbs do not act quickly enough to help with a mixture that takes effect in just 1 {\round}.
To prevent these, a witch might look into \featref{vomit-potion}.

\section{Side-Effects}

While some of the more noxious mixtures a witch can brew produce adverse effects by design, these are not the only ways a potion can hurt.
Many mixtures come with adverse side effects all by themselves, and these are compounded by the dangers of overdosing and combining brews.

\subsection{Overdosing}

Many potions carry harmful effects when taking too many doses.
These typically only occur if multiple doses would be in effect simultaneously; taking another dose after the first has worn off is safe unless specified.
Some of the effects of overdoses are given explicitly, but many are given as general guidelines.
The GM is left to adjudicate in the latter case.
Typically the worst effects of overdosing can be staved off with a \attref{might} {\test}, with the {\tn} affected by how many excess doses have been taken, and how close in succession they were taken.

If you wish to keep a brew's effect going continuously, and you have access to additional doses of the brew, it is easy enough to take another dose as you feel the first wearing off.
You can do this without any risk of overdosing.

\subsection{Mixing Mixtures}

Mixing multiple potions can have adverse and unexpected effects.
These kick in when a character is under the effect of two substances that both affect the same attribute, or other statistic.
The effects are unpredictable.
The GM is free to apply any appropriate penalty, possibly calling for a \attref{might} {\test} to avoid or alleviate the effects.
The following table is provided for inspiration.
The GM may roll 2 six-sided dice and compare their sum against the table to randomly determine an effect, if desired.

\begin{simpletable}{rX}
	\toprule
	\dice{2} & Effect\\
	\midrule
	2 & Apply severe overdose effects of the first mixture.\\
	3 & Exhaustion, unconsciousness and/or oxygen deprivation.\\
	4 & Apply moderate overdose effects of the first mixture.\\
	5 & Ignore any positive effects of the first mixture.\\
	6 & Double any detrimental effects of the first mixture.\\
	7 & Re-roll twice on the table, taking both results.\\
	8 & Double any detrimental effects of the second mixture.\\
	9 & Ignore any positive effects of the second mixture.\\
	10 & Apply moderate overdose effects of the second mixture.\\
	11 & Twitching, seizure, overheating and/or organ failure.\\
	12 & Apply severe overdose effects of the second mixture.\\
	\bottomrule
\end{simpletable}

The effect of painkillers---to ignore {\damage}---does not count as a statistic for the purpose of mixing substances.
As such, a character may safely be under the effects of multiple painkillers as long as their other effects do not overlap.
Additionally, withdrawal effects (such as those of \featref{mental-stimulant}) do not count for mixing.
%TODO: Use a better example when I have a withdrawal effect that modifies statistics.

\section{Antidotes}
\seclabel{antidotes}

While vomiting can help to avoid the effects of a potion \emph{before} they kick in, ending the effects once they are ongoing requires an {\antidote}.
\capital{\antidotes} exist not just for poisons, but for any potion or other mixture with an ongoing effect.
Each {\antidote} will only work on potions it is designed to counteract, however.
It will specify in its description what sorts of potion it is effective against.

\capital{\antidotes} can be delivered through different methods, just like potions themselves, and take the usual length of time to kick in.
Once it kicks in, the {\antidote} ends all ongoing effects of any potions it is designed to counteract.
One dose of {\antidote} can end the effect of several different potions, as long as it is designed to counteract all of them, or several doses of the same potion.

When an {\antidote} takes effect, treat it as though the duration of the potion has expired.
An {\antidote} ends both beneficial and detrimental effects, but can only end \emph{ongoing} effects.
Any {\damage} that has been dealt stays dealt.
Overdose effects are ended, but organs that have failed are not repaired, and so on.
Withdrawal effects (such as \featref{mental-stimulant}), are not ended by an {\antidote}.
In fact, taking an {\antidote} causes the withdrawal effects to kick in, as it ends the effect of the potion.

The effect of an {\antidote} is immediate, not ongoing.
This means that you cannot have an {\antidote} to an {\antidote}.
