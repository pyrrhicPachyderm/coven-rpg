\discipline{Projection}{projection}{Projector}{Projectors}

\dropcapdiscref{projection} is, broadly, a witch's ability to have her mind leave her own body.
Once freed from its earthly shackles, her mind can wander freely, unimpeded by walls, oceans, or even vast distances.
She can sense the minds of others, finding them, following them, listening to them, and reading them.
She can even displace them from their bodies, taking them over.

Some witches, always eager to put a mystical spin on everything, refer to the process as Astral Projection.
Most just stick to \discref{projection}.
The experts, however, often forgo even this phrase.
Many forget what it was ever like to be trapped within their own body, and treat \discref{projection} as a natural and integral part of their lives.
It isn't uncommon to hear a witch say ``I'm just popping out,'' a moment before her body slumps, catatonic, to the floor.

Expert \practitioners{projection} often treat their body like a favoured pair of shoes, to be worn and discarded as needed.
Many even prefer to go barefoot, and won't think twice about borrowing someone else's shoes in an emergency.
They make a complete separation between a person's mind and body, treating the natural coupling of the two as a mere convenience.
This lends such a witch a great flexibility, but can be terrifying to those less accustomed to the practice.

\capital{\discref{projection}} is a strictly mental discipline.
It features none of the circles and gestures of \discref{ritual-magic}, nor even the physical cues that often accompany \discref{willing}.
In fact, with her mind gone, an unskilled witch leaves her body totally catatonic.

But as much as it fails to engage the body, \discref{projection} engages almost every part of the mind.
A witch uses her \attref{heed} to sense the minds of others; her \attref{wit} to reach them, to probe them, to find the cracks and leverage them; and her \attref{will} to ram another mind, to shunt it from its body and replace it with her own.
Lastly, her \attref{wit} is once again important if she grows lost, and needs to navigate back to her own body.

\section{The Mental Realm}
\seclabel{the-mental-realm}

The {\mentalrealm} is not truly a different realm, so much as it is a different way of experiencing our own one.
\capital{\discref{projection}} is the ability to cast one's mind out into this realm, and to operate within it.

The {\mentalrealm} is not experienced with any of the normal senses, tied as these senses are to organs such as the eyes, ears and skin.
But if one had to describe it, it might go something like this:

Imagine a vast, grey plain.
It stretches away forever in all directions.
\emph{All} directions, for there is no ground, no sky.
You do not fall, just float.
There is no up, no down, no north, south, east or west.
Not unless you brought them with you.

And you had better hope you did, because there are no landmarks.
Everything is pervaded by a cold, grey fog.
It is thick.
So thick that you would be wading through it, if you still had legs.
You'd hardly see your own hand in front of your face, if you had a hand, or a face.

Only one thing shines through the fog.
It is dim, so dim, but it is close.
In fact, it seems to be inside of you.
It \emph{is} you---part of you.
The `you' that you left behind.
There isn't much there now.
Your body, catatonic, rigid.
The barest traces of thought, keeping you breathing, keeping your heart beating.

As you adjust to the gloom, you strain the eyes you do not have and peer deep into the fog.
The faintest hints of light shine through.
They move, dance, and play in the distance.
Some shine brighter, some softer.
They are the minds of others, still living in the realm you have left behind.

You could reach out and touch them, if you wanted.
Just one quick step over there, pushing your way into the fog.
But you can still feel the light beside, inside of you.
It is so dim.
If you stepped away, would you be able to find it again?
Or would you be lost in the fog forever?

\subsection{Using the Mental Realm}
\seclabel{using-the-mental-realm}

A witch may enter the {\mentalrealm} by taking a \featref{projection-start}.
Her body is left catatonic and helpless, although still alive and breathing, while her mind departs.
She enters the {\mentalrealm} with her mind safely beside her body, able to return to it at any point she chooses.

Even a novice entering the {\mentalrealm} can sense nearby minds.
The fog that fills the realm prevents this sense from reaching far.
Minds in the same room can be sensed automatically, while a \testtype{heed}{projection} might extend the sense to fill a house or more.
Interaction or communication with another mind, beyond simply observing it, is incredibly limited for a novice---see the section \secref{mental-interfaces}.

You can gather some information about a creature by observing its mind in the {\mentalrealm}.
Most obvious is the intelligence of the creature.
The mind of a human or familiar shines brightly, while animals are dimmer.
Particularly simple animals---worms, insects, and the like---are barely noticeable at all.
It is also fairly easy to tell what type of creature it is---the shapes of two creature's minds are normally as distinct as the shapes of their bodies.
If you know an individual, you can even recognise them in the {\mentalrealm} as easily as you would by seeing their face.
Additionally, it is easy to tell when a mind is sleeping, or otherwise unconscious.

By careful inspection of a mind, it is often possible to glean even more information.
This typically requires a \testtype{heed}{projection} {\test}.
Firstly, you can get some idea of the power of a mind, telling a canny human from a dullard.
A witch, in particular, tends to have a noticeably brighter mind than most folk.
Secondly, it is occasionally possible to tell when someone's mind does not match who you have physically seen them to be.
It is far harder to disguise the mind than the body, so this can be used to catch someone who is disguised as someone, or something, else.
Any instances of {\possession} are also fairly obvious from within the {\mentalrealm}.

Moving within the {\mentalrealm} is easy.
Navigating is not.
Time and space work strangely, allowing a mind to shift itself miles in a mere moment.
However, the same effect allows an untrained or careless mind to shift itself a long way out of place, just as quickly.
Furthermore, there is no sense of location or direction, and no landmarks besides the minds themselves.
A mind can shift itself to any other mind that it can sense, and follow it around as it moves, but anything else is pure guesswork.
Such guesswork uses \testtype{wit}{projection} {\tests}.

While in the {\mentalrealm}, a mind is freed from all the trappings of a body.
It has no \attref{might} or \attref{grace} scores, though no {\tests} using \attref{might} or \attref{grace} are ever necessary in the {\mentalrealm}.
It is also unaffected by any diseases, poisons, or potions that affected its body.
Even non-physical attributes are returned to their normal scores, unaffected by any potions.
It is still affected by {\exhaustion} of non-physical attributes, however.

Furthermore, without access to the physical world, a witch cannot use magic from other disciplines while in the {\mentalrealm}.
Feats from outside the \discref{projection} discipline cannot be used in the {\mentalrealm}, unless specified.
In most cases, the requirement for physical components makes this obvious, but even feats such as \featref{hindsight} and \featref{foresight}, from \discref{divination}, cannot naturally be used there.

\subsection{Denizens of the Mental Realm}

The most obvious denizens of the mental realm are other humans: their busy, intelligent minds shine brightly there.
Familiars, too, are intelligent and obvious there.
Other animals, however, have smaller and duller minds.
Most are not hidden, by any means, but are not so bright and obvious.
The minds of earthworms, fleas and such as so small and simple as to be almost imperceptible.

Most undead also have simpler, duller minds, much like animals.
Mindless creatures, such as golems, have no presence in the {\mentalrealm} at all.
The strangest creatures, however, are those with a single mind composed of many smaller pieces, such as a hive of bees.
It is always obvious that there is \emph{something} there, but it is so diffuse that a novice might not recognise it as a mind.
Interacting with such a mind is certainly impossible for all but the most experienced witches.

Occasionally, spirits are also detectable in the {\mentalrealm}.
In fact, several kinds of spirit exist solely there.
But beware: not all are benevolent.

Lastly, the minds of other witches performing \discref{projection} are present and easily noticeable.
As usual, they cannot communicate there, but they can still identify and follow one another.
It is common practice for an apprentice to follow her mentor into the {\mentalrealm}, to receive a tour and be led safely back to her body afterwards.

\subsection{Lifelines}
\seclabel{mental-lifeline}

A mind is always connected to its own body by a {\lifeline}.
This {\lifeline} serves two purposes.

Firstly, the mind, departed as it may be, still depends on the brain for survival.
If a witch's body is killed, her {\lifeline} is severed, and her mind dies too.
This occurs regardless of where her mind is, even if she is {\possessing} someone else.
As such, she must return to her body periodically to eat and drink, just as usual.
Furthermore, \discref{projection} is not a restful exercise.
A witch still suffers sleep deprivation if she does not return to her body and enjoy natural sleep at the usual rate.

The second use of a {\lifeline} is equally essential to a witch who wishes to make use of \discref{projection}.
While {\lifelines} are imperceptible to the untrained, a skilled witch comes to detect her {\lifeline} and follow it back to her body.
The distance at which she can do this is limited---the {\lifeline} stretches thinner and grows harder to detect as she moves from her body---but inside that distance she is in no danger of getting lost, and may return to her own body in an instant (not even requiring a {\action}).

A witch who has not yet learned to sense her {\lifeline} ought to remain where she can still sense her own mind.
As a novice, this range is only a handful of metres, severely limiting activities.

A witch can only sense {\lifelines}---her own, or any others she has learned to sense---while she is within the {\mentalrealm}.

\section{Possession}
\seclabel{possession}

Besides getting lost, another major risk of \discref{projection} is {\possession}.
The body a witch leaves behind when she enters the {\mentalrealm} is not just physically helpless, but vulnerable to mental intrusion.
Thankfully, most spirits don't have the skill or the power to invade even an undefended mind.
But every so often, a witch might return to her body to find it occupied by something else.

However, {\possession} is also a power that a witch skilled in \discref{projection} can use to her own advantage.
Such a witch learns to take up residence in an unoccupied body, or even to invade and displace an existing occupant.

A displaced occupant always finds themselves in the {\mentalrealm}, even if they haven't the skill to enter it willingly.
This comes as a frightful shock to the uninitiated, but most have the basic instinct to remain close to the nearest light---the mind now possessing their own body---until such a time as they might return to it.

\subsection{Possessed Creatures}

A {\possessed} creature uses the body's \attref{might} and \attref{grace}, but the {\possessing} mind's other attributes, skills, and feats.
The {\possessing} mind has full control of the body, and may retain it indefinitely.

However, the body's owner always has the strongest claim to it, and may attempt to displace a {\possessing} mind.
To do so, it must be adjacent in the {\mentalrealm}, and trying to force its way back in.
Whenever the {\possessing} creature is shocked in some fashion, such as by {\damage}, a slap to the face, a dunk in icy water, or the revelation of a terrible secret, the body's original owner gets an attempt to reassert control.
She makes a \testtype{will}{projection} {\test}, {\opposed} by the {\possessing} mind's \testtype{will}{projection} {\test}.
If she succeeds, she displaces the {\possessing} mind back into the {\mentalrealm}, and regains control of her body.
If the {\possessing} mind leaves at any point, the original owner can immediately regain control.

One risk for a {\possessing} creature to bear in mind is that of unconsciousness, and death.
If a body would be knocked unconscious, the possessing mind blacks out with them.
Worst of all, if the body dies, the shock always kills the occupying mind.
With the mind's death, the {\lifeline} collapses, and the {\possessing} creature's body dies soon after.

If {\possession} becomes particularly prevalent in a game, it may become possible for a body to contain multiple minds over the course of a {\round}.
Even if this occurs, the body is limited to one {\action} and its usual quantity of movement per {\round}.
Similarly, a mind that occupies multiple bodies is limited to one {\action} and one allotment of movement on its {\turn}.

Note that a {\possessing} mind which wants to leave the body must do so by the usual means.
For example, if it only has the feat \featref{projection-start}, it still requires a minute to leave the body.
It may willingly cede the body to its original owner as an {\action}, but only if the original owner is trying to force its way back in.

\section{Mental Interfaces}
\seclabel{mental-interfaces}

From the {\mentalrealm}, there are many ways to interact with other minds, besides shunting them aside and {\possessing} their bodies.
You can read minds, see through other people's eyes, and talk straight into their heads.
But first, you must establish an {\interface}.

To establish an {\interface} with another mind, you must be in the {\mentalrealm}, and touching the other mind.
That mind can be inside a body or loose in the {\mentalrealm} beside you, and it can be a human mind, or the mind of some other creature.
Establishing an {\interface} does not require an {\action}, but it must be done on your {\turn}.

\capital{\interfaces} come in two kinds: {\overtinterfaces} and {\subtleinterfaces}.
The {\interfaces} are not mutually exclusive---you may establish both at the same time.

\capital{\subtleinterfaces} are simpler, but weaker.
You may establish a {\subtleinterface} with any mind you touch, with no restrictions, and the affected mind remains unaware of it.

\capital{\overtinterfaces} are stronger, but require the active participation of both recipients.
You can only try to establish an {\overtinterface} with a mind that is awake.
The intended recipient feels the attempt, and it feels your presence.
It gets as much information as it would get from observing your mind within the {\mentalrealm}---enough to identify you if it knows you.
To establish the {\interface}, it must actively accept it.
Doing so is easy---anyone can manage it.

An {\interface} only lasts while your minds remain touching in the {\mentalrealm}, though one mind can easily follow another around.
You can break it off at any time.
In the case of an {\overtinterface}, the target can also break it off at any time, and it automatically breaks if the target falls unconscious.
Furthermore, the target can allow only certain aspects of an {\overtinterface}, allowing you to use the abilities of one feat, but not another, on it.

An {\interface} does nothing for a novice witch---she needs feats to be able to make use of it.
Note, however, that the attempt to establish an {\overtinterface} can be used to inform someone that she is there, in the {\mentalrealm}, beside it.

\section{Feats}

	You may lift others out of their own bodies and into the {\mentalrealm}, if they come willingly.
	You may, as an {\action}, attempt to mindlift a creature with which you have an {\overtinterface}.
	If the creature co-operates, its mind enters the {\mentalrealm} beside yours, leaving its body open to {\possession}.

\feat{Mindjack}{projection-start-other-2}{20}{
	\skillref[1]{projection},

}{
	A \featref{projection-start-other} requires that the target \emph{co-operates}, but with a little skill you can find success as long as they \emph{are unable to resist}.
	If you have a {\subtleinterface} with an \emph{unconscious} creature's mind, you may attempt to mindjack it as an {\action}.
	You and the creature make {\opposed} \testtype{will}{projection} {\tests}.
	On a success, its mind enters the {\mentalrealm} beside yours, leaving its body open to {\possession}.
	
	Whether you succeed or fail, the creature is awakened, unless it is unconscious due to poisoning or the like, and hence unable to be roused in any fashion.
	It is aware of the attempt to invade its mind.
	To save repeated rolling, the GM might allow automatic success against a target that would not be roused by an unsuccessful attempt.
	In this case, however, a creature that subsequently {\possesses} the body might find itself affected by whatever poison rendered the creature unconscious in the first place.

	On a success, its mind enters the {\mentalrealm} beside yours, leaving its body open to {\possession}.
	
	It is very much aware of the attempt to displace its mind.
	Furthermore, ramming a fortified position with your bare mind is a good recipe for hurting yourself.

	An unoccupied body is an enticing prospect for a roaming mind, and it's not particularly hard to slide one's own mind into it.

	This does not even require an {\action}, and hence may be done in the same {\turn} as you perform a \featref{projection-start-other}, \featref{projection-start-other-2}, or \featref{projection-start-other-3}.

	This sense also wakes you up if the {\interface} is established while you are sleeping, just as if someone had touched your face.
	You may, however, turn the sense off if you are sick of people waking you up with it.
	You are still aware if there is an {\interface} in place when you awake.

	The person establishing the {\interface} gets no sense of this, however, and is not aware that you \emph{could} have blocked them if you decide to let them through.
	
	When you sleep, you may choose to block all {\interfaces} without being awoken, allow them through without being awoken, or be awoken by each attempt in order to choose.

	You can already send images flashing, unbidden, into people's heads.
	But this always comes across as obviously supernatural.
	If you're a little subtler about it, and do it while they're asleep, you can make them seem like natural dreams.
	
	While you have a {\subtleinterface} with a sleeping creature's mind, you can shape its dreams.
	You choose what it sees, hears, smells, and so on, and even whether it dreams in the first place.
	You can even take control of how it acts within its dreams, or allow it of act of its own volition.
	In the latter case, however, you cannot sense how it chooses to act without an effect like \featref{projection-read-mind-2}.
	
	The creature is not normally aware that it is dreaming, even in the most outlandish situations.
	The GM may, however, allow the creature to make a {\test}---a difficult one---in order to notice.
	
	You may force the creature to remember the dream, if you wish.
	Otherwise, it must make a \attref{ken} {\test} to remember it.
	If it does remember the dream, it normally realises that it was a dream after it awakes.
	
	If you spend most of the night causing the creature to have nightmares, its sleep is fitful and restless.
	The sleep does not help it recover from {\damage} or {\exhaustion}, although they may still recover 1 point of {\damage} and 1 level of {\exhaustion} from a {\dayofrest}.
	If this goes on for several nights, it may begin suffering {\exhaustion} due to sleep deprivation.
	Of course, if you spend all night doing this, you are not sleeping yourself.
	
	This only works on a \emph{sleeping} creature---sleeping naturally, or due to something like \featref{sleep-potion}.
	It does not work on a creature knocked unconscious by {\shock}, or the like.

\feat{Shape of a Mind}{projection-read-mind}{10}{
	\featref{projection-start}

	Emotions are a powerful force, gripping a creature's mind, and altering its entire nature.
	Though subtle, this change is noticeable in the {\mentalrealm}.
	
	While you have a {\subtleinterface} with another mind, you can feel its emotions.
	This is not simply a vague impression, but a very particular sense which you can feel varying moment-to-moment.
	However, the GM might call for a {\test} to detect better-hidden emotions, such as a twinge of guilt overwhelmed by a great sense of triumph.
	
	It is true that emotions can often just be read on a person's face, without risking a trip to the {\mentalrealm}, however it is far harder for a liar to control their mind than their face.
	Animal's faces, too, can prove harder to interpret than their minds.
	This technique can be used very effectively in concert with an accomplice to direct questions at the target.

\feat{Mental Eavesdropping}{projection-read-mind-2}{20}{
	\featref{projection-read-mind}
}{
	While the shape of a creature's mind betrays its emotions, listening to its \emph{thoughts} requires a slightly deeper probing.
	While you have a {\subtleinterface} with another mind, you can listen to its thoughts.
	This isn't an active mind reading so much as a passive mind eavesdropping.
	You can only hear its active train of thought, the words running through its head whenever you happen to be listening.
	If it is speaking, these are normally the words it is saying.
	
	You can only understand these thoughts if the creature is thinking in a language you understand, which tends to limit the ability to humans, familiars, and other intelligent creatures.
	%TODO: Reference a druidcraft feat that lets you understand animal speech/thought.
	Furthermore, a rigidly controlled and disciplined mind can prevent certain thoughts from slipping into this internally vocalised stream, if it has reason to suspect it is being eavesdropped upon.
	There are even rumours of witches who have fooled mental eavesdroppers by intentionally lying in their own thoughts.

	When you establish an {\overtinterface}, you can strengthen it, merging both minds together.
	You can think as one, and even move as one if the target is currently inhabiting a body.
	
	While your minds are merged, you may make any {\tests} using the attributes of skills from either participant in the mind meld.
	You may even use the attribute score from one participant and the skill rank from the other.
	Note that a mind in the {\mentalrealm} does not have a \attref{might} or \attref{grace} score, so {\tests} using these scores must always use the body's score.
	
	Ultimately, the mind you have merged with remains in control.
	It always retains the final say in any movements and actions.
	Furthermore, you cannot work magic through a body using a mind meld.
	You cannot use any feats that you would not normally be able to use while in the {\mentalrealm}.

	When you use \featref{projection-merge}, you may work your magic through someone else.
	The melded mind can use the feats of both participants.
	
	For feats which require sustained magic---those that would end if you died---maintenance is tracked separately for each mind in the meld.
	This primarily affects the number of {\symlinks}, scrying sensors, golems, or controlled undead that can be maintained.
	When a new one is established or animated, it must be assigned to one mind or the other.
	Note that a witch with no relevant feats cannot maintain even one of these things.
	For example, if only one of you has any \discref{sympathetic-magic} feats, the melded mind can only maintain one {\symlink}.

	Amplifying or suppressing the emotion is easy, though particularly extreme cases might require a {\test}.
	
	With a {\test}, you might even be able to redirect the emotion.
	For example, you could make someone angry at themselves, instead of at their child.
	You must still redirect it to a reasonable target; you can't make them angry at themselves unless they carry at least a portion of the blame for what they're angry about.

	It is one thing to change what a person senses in their dreams, when everything they see is a fiction of their mind.

	Thankfully, it's a trick you know.
	
	While you have a {\subtleinterface} with a mind that currently resides within a body, you can alter what it senses.
	The senses you can affect are the same senses you can borrow, as determined by which of the feats \featref{projection-read-sight}, \featref{projection-read-hearing}, and \featref{projection-read-senses} you have.
	
	For now, your influence is subtle; you cannot fabricate \emph{everything} they sense, like you can while they are asleep.
	If you affect vision, you can make them see flashes of movement, change the colour of something, hide a small object from their view, alter someone enough such that they don't recognise them, or the like.
	You cannot form an entirely new object, unless it is very simple, and you cannot make someone look like someone else entirely.
	If you affect hearing, you can make noises, even loud ones, coming from a particular direction, but not with enough precision to synthesise speech.
