\section{Reanimation and Resurrection}

Many \practitioners{necromancy} draw a distinction between reanimation and resurrection.
Reanimation is a crude process, somewhat akin to \discref{golemancy}.
It's nothing more than the application of raw animating force to a corpse, to stand it up and get it shuffling around again.
The creature retains its instincts, its muscle memory and the like, but that's as much through what is left of its biology as it is through the will that animated it.
The results of reanimation are known as the undead.

Resurrection, by contrast, brings a creature back back to life in full, and the creature's {\soul} is restored to its body.
There may be a few ill effects of the process, not to mention whatever killed it in the first place, but these can typically be recovered from.
For all intents and purposes, the creature is just as much alive as it was in the first place.

In theory, at least.

The trouble is that nobody has ever achieved true resurrection.
Dozens of witches and hundreds of charlatans have all claimed to.
Many have even come incredibly close, but there has always been some slight snag.
The search, of course, continues, but many have given up all hope that it is possible.

\section{Reanimation Rituals \& the Undead}
\seclabel{reanimation-rituals}

Undead, the products of reanimation, come in many different forms: \undeadrefplural{zombie}, \undeadrefplural{skeleton}, \undeadrefplural{ghoul}, and more.
The rituals to reanimate these creatures are just as numerous, but they all share mark{\'e}d similarities.
And many \practitioners{necromancy}, who consider these rituals to form the heart of the discipline, learn a lot of techniques for improving them.

For convenience, the feats which modify these rituals refer to them collectively as the {\reanimationrituals}, and the feats which provide them are listed here.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-zombie}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-skeleton}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-ghoul}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-draugr}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-sea-draugr}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-fossil}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-fire-skeleton}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-shade}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-wraith}}
\end{itemize}
Obviously, you cannot perform any variant of a ritual unless you have the feat to perform that ritual in the first place.

\subsection{The Lurching Dead}

The statistics and capabilities of an undead creature are based upon the statistics and capabilities of the creature whose corpse it is raised from.
Each variety of undead comes with its own associated changes to these statistics, listed in the following sections.
Many changes, however, are shared between all reanimated creatures, and are listed here.

Most reanimations do nothing to heal {\damage} to the corpse: both {\damage} suffered before and during death, and any further {\damage} done to the corpse since then.
If this reduces its \statref{shock-threshold} to 0 or below, the corpse is too mangled to successfully reanimate.
Some reanimations also require an unrotted corpse.
It usually takes a little over a week before a corpse becomes too rotted for such a reanimation, although temperature and moisture can alter this.
Corpses can be preserved by {\embalming}.

A reanimated creature loses its memory and identity.
It retains general knowledge such as how to hunt, but forgets such information as the location of its den, and loses any mannerisms that distinguished it in life.
It retains {\generalskills}, but loses {\specialityskills}, {\disciplineskills}, and feats.

Most reanimated creatures also lack many biological processes that they had in life.
They do not need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep.
They are immune to poisons, diseases, and the like.
Additionally, they cannot heal themselves or be healed, and are unaffected by potions and such.
They do not suffer from {\shock}, and are simply deanimated if they suffer a {\damagetest} equalling or exceeding their \statref{shock-threshold}.
They still suffer from {\exhaustion}, although they don't need sleep to recover from it; just rest.
Lastly, they cannot produce any venom or other such substances, so any benefit of a venomous bite, sting, or the like is lost.

When you reanimate a creature, the resulting undead is under your control.
You control it mentally, without need for verbal instructions or gestures.
However, you can only maintain control while you remain conscious, and nearby---at least near enough to see or otherwise sense it.
If you fall asleep, fall unconscious, die, get too far away from the creature, or leave your body for the {\mentalrealm}, you lose control over it.
A novice \practitioner{necromancy} has no way to regain control over an undead creature once she loses it, other than to kill the creature and reanimate the corpse again.

When you lose control over an undead, it regains free will.
It begins to act as an animal of its kind normally would, seeking out whichever food it would normally eat.
However, it is eternally, ravenously, and insatiably hungry.
It's generally considered good practice to put an undead down, rather than to lose control of it.

A witch who can raise an undead creature learns to control one, and only one, at a time.
When you reanimate a second creature, you must either relinquish control of the previous one, or immediately lose control of the new one.

\undead{Zombie}{Zombies}{zombie}{
	A \undeadref{zombie} is the simplest reanimation possible; the corpse, fully clothed in its own flesh, is simply stood up and walked around as it is.
	Is it a clumsy creature, with most of the mind rotted away as well, and it only grows worse as the corpse rots further.
	
	A corpse reanimated as a \undeadref{zombie} loses 2 points from all attributes except \attref{might} and \attref{will}.
	Its \statref{speed} is halved.
	Its \statref{shock-threshold} increases by 2, however.
	If it could fly, it is now too clumsy to do so.
	
	A corpse reanimated as a \undeadref{zombie} is not healed of any {\damage}.
	The reanimation also requires that the corpse is unrotted.
	Furthermore, it does nothing to slow the rot.
	A \undeadref{zombie} that rots too far loses animation.
}

\undead{Ghoul}{Ghouls}{ghoul}{
	A \undeadref{ghoul} retains greater mental and physical faculties than a \undeadref{zombie}, but this comes at a dangerous price.
	A \undeadref{ghoul} is sustained only by consuming the flesh of its own kind.
	For example, a rabbit \undeadref{ghoul} must consume rabbit flesh, and a human \undeadref{ghoul} must consume human flesh.
	
	A corpse reanimated as a \undeadref{ghoul} loses 2 points from its \attref{ken}, \attref{wit}, and \attref{charm} scores.
	It retains the ability to fly, if it could in life.
	
	A corpse reanimated as a \undeadref{ghoul} is not healed of any {\damage}.
	However, an animated \undeadref{ghoul} may heal {\damage} by consuming the flesh of its own kind.
	An entire corpse is sufficient to restore {\damage} equal to its maximum \statref{shock-threshold}, with smaller portions restoring proportionally smaller amounts.
	A ghoul can consume an entire corpse in less than a minute, and there is no end to its hunger: it could consume corpses for hours on end without being sated.
	\undeadrefplural{ghoul} created from partial corpses, such as with \featref{undead-head}, need only eat their own mass to count it as a full corpse.
	
	Reanimating a corpse as a \undeadref{ghoul} also requires that it is unrotted.
	While animated and fed at least one full corpse each week, however, a \undeadref{ghoul} does not continue to rot.
	
	Lastly, a \undeadrefpossessive{ghoul} unnatural hunger makes it harder to control than most undead.
	It must be fed a full corpse at least once a week, or it always breaks free of the \practitionerpossessive{necromancy} control.
	Even a \undeadref{ghoul} reanimated as a \undeadref{souled} is not immune to this: it goes insane with hunger after a week, and does not return to sanity until it has fed again.
}

\undead{Draugr}{Draugar}{draugr}{
	With all the moisture drawn out of a corpse, it is not only prevented from rotting, but can also be freed from the bloated clumsiness that afflicts \undeadrefplural{zombie}.
	The result is a \undeadref{draugr} (plural \undeadrefplural{draugr}).
	The better preservation also grants it a better memory and senses.
	
	A corpse reanimated as a \undeadref{draugr} loses 2 points from its \attref{wit}, \attref{charm}, and \attref{presence} scores.
	It retains the ability to fly, if it could in life.
	
	A corpse reanimated as a \undeadref{draugr} is not healed of any {\damage}.
	The reanimation requires that the corpse is unrotted, and it also must be {\embalmed} by desiccation (drying out).
	This usually is usually done using salt, but can happen naturally to creatures that die in deserts.
	
	To remain animated, the \undeadref{draugr} must be kept dry; water bloats the corpse, starts it rotting again, and immediately ends its animation.
	It might manage a 30 second sprint through light rain, but heavier rain is too much.
	Given a heavy leather coat, it might just about be able to travel through rain, but the moisture will still get to it in a couple of hours.
	The \undeadref{draugr} is aware of this limitation, and will avoid moisture when not under a \practitionerpossessive{necromancy} direct control.
	
	\undeadrefplural{draugr} are often used to guard ancient tombs, sealed inside where water cannot intrude.
}

\undead{Sea-Draugr}{Sea-Draugar}{sea-draugr}{
	The \undeadrefplural{sea-draugr} are, in many ways, the complete opposite of the regular \undeadrefplural{draugr}.
	Creatures of seas and lakes, they can only be animated from the corpses of those who died by drowning.
	They revel in their water-bloated flesh, lurking beneath the surface and dragging their prey to join them in their watery grave.
	
	A \undeadref{sea-draugr} is subject to the same rules as a regular \undeadref{draugr}.
	It also gains a swimming speed equal to its land speed, or half its flying speed, whichever is greater.
	
	However, instead of remaining dry, an \undeadref{sea-draugr} must remain soaked.
	It functions best when immersed in water, and begins to weaken about five minutes after it emerges.
	After about ten minutes, it dries out too much and completely loses animation.
	
	Regular wetting can extend this time; it might get half an hour in rain, or even an indefinite time if the rain is sufficiently torrential.
	\emph{Continuous} attention using \featref{willing-water-vapour}, or a couple of uses of \featref{willing-water-vapour-2} every 5 minutes, also suffices.
	However, it must be completely immersed for at least 8 hours each day.
	Just like a \undeadref{draugr}, a \undeadref{sea-draugr} is aware of this limitation, and will seek out water.
	
	As long as the corpse remains animated as a \undeadref{sea-draugr}, and sufficiently wetted, it will not continue to rot.
}

\undead{Skeleton}{Skeletons}{skeleton}{
	A \undeadref{skeleton} is the result of reanimating only the bones of a creature, the flesh rotted or carved away.
	The bones arrange themselves in the air, supported by nothing but the will of the animating witch, and the creature's conviction in its own shape.
	The result is a creature far less clumsy than a zombie, but not so resilient.
	
	A corpse reanimated as a \undeadref{skeleton} loses 2 points from all attributes except \attref{grace} and \attref{will}.
	Its \statref{shock-threshold} is also reduced by 2, in addition to the loss from the reduced \attref{might}.
	The mere bones of wings are not sufficient to allow it to fly, if it previously could.
	It also sinks in water, but may move along the bottom.
	
	Requiring only the bones, a \undeadref{skeleton} is not affected by most {\damage} sustained by the corpse.
	Only a critical success on a {\damagetest}, or an intentional effort after death, will typically have broken any bones.
	Likewise, it is not affected by {\damage} in the course of its undeath; any blow insufficient to scatter it across the floor is insufficient to scratch its bones.
	
	A \undeadref{skeleton} lasts a long time without decomposing; at least a decade, and even longer if kept dry.
}

\undead{Living Fossil}{Living Fossils}{fossil}{
	A \undeadref{fossil} is much like a \undeadref{skeleton}, except that the bones have been mineralised, impregnated with stone.
	The essence of earth permeates the creature, strengthening it.
	
	A \undeadref{fossil} uses the same rules as a \undeadref{skeleton}, except that its \attref{might} is not reduced.
	Additionally, fossilised bones do not decay, lasting millennia and more.
}

\undead{Blazing Skeleton}{Blazing Skeletons}{fire-skeleton}{
	A \undeadref{fire-skeleton} can only be made from the charred bones of a creature that died burning.
	Flames race across its bones as it walks, and its eye sockets blaze like the sun.
	It spreads destruction wherever it steps, leaving fire and ash in its wake.
	
	A \undeadref{fire-skeleton} mostly uses the same rules as a \undeadref{skeleton}, with a handful of differences.
	Firstly, the bones used to animate must be charred by fire.
	This should not be enough to totally destroy the bones, but even badly fire-damaged bones have no ill effects on the resulting \undeadref{fire-skeleton}.
	
	Secondly, the \undeadref{fire-skeleton} always burns, as long as it is animated.
	It burns without fuel, and without damaging itself---in fact, it is immune to all harm from fire and heat.
	The fire goes out if the \undeadref{fire-skeleton} loses animation.
	Conversely, the \undeadref{fire-skeleton} loses animation if the fire is extinguished, such as by being immersed in water.
	The fire is somewhat robust, however; it can survive moderate rain, simply causing the droplets to boil away.
	
	The \undeadrefpossessive{fire-skeleton} flames produce heat, and can combust things, just like normal flame.
	They will ignite most combustible materials they touch.
	A \undeadrefpossessive{fire-skeleton} {\unarmed} attacks also {\ignite} the target, at \dice{2}, or add 1 die of {\fire} to a target who is already burning.
}

\undead{Shade}{Shades}{shade}{
	While it is truly an undead, a reanimated corpse, a \undeadrefplural{shade} bears some resemblance to {\ghosts}.
	It shares some of their insubstantial nature, being a part of this realm, but not truly a creature of it.
	It always appears to be wreathed in shadow, and every part of it is dark: black or grey.
	Its facial features are indistinct, or even absent.
	
	Although it is formed from a creature's body, a \undeadref{shade} is insubstantial.
	It often finds its fingers passing straight through objects, like shadows flitting over them.
	Although this makes it harder to affect the world, it also affords the \undeadref{shade} a degree of protection.
	Swords can pass right through it, without even disturbing it.
	
	Light, however, brings the \undeadref{shade} form, clarity.
	This makes it vulnerable.
	Worse still, sunlight can burn it away entirely, destroying it.
	
	A \undeadref{shade} loses 2 points from its \attref{ken}, \attref{charm}, and \attref{presence} scores.
	Furthermore, its insubstantial nature causes it to lose 5 points from its \attref{might} score.
	However, it suffers no penalties to vision in low-light conditions, or even complete darkness.
	And, in complete darkness, it is immune to all physical harm.
	
	Light, even dim light, makes the \undeadref{shade} vulnerable again.
	If the light falls only on part of its body, only that part is vulnerable.
	Sunlight, however, is worse.
	The \undeadref{shade} suffers a \dice{5} {\damagetest} every {\round} that it is exposed to direct sunlight.
	Reducing exposure can reduce the number of dice rolled for the {\damagetest}, but even if it wrapped entirely in thick black cloth, leaving just its eyes exposed so that it might see causes it to suffer a \dice{1} {\damagetest} every round.
	
	Reanimating a corpse as a \undeadref{shade} requires that it is unrotted, but it does not continue to rot while it is animated.
	When the \undeadref{shade} is deanimated, it leaves the corpse fully corporeal again, albeit with a slightly dark pallor, and still affected by any {\damage} the \undeadref{shade} suffered.
	If the \undeadref{shade} is deanimated in sunlight, however, it burns away entirely, leaving no corpse---not even ash.
}

\undead{Wraith}{Wraiths}{wraith}{
	A \undeadref{wraith} is the invention of a foul \practitioner{necromancy} from a bygone era.
	She sacrificed dozens of people to the darkness of a \creatureref{stygian-nightshade}, then recovered their flayed corpses for reanimation.
	The result was a variety of \undeadref{shade} that carried the \creaturerefpossessive{stygian-nightshade} wicked claws, able to rend flesh despite their intangibility.
	The process has been refined since, and needs nothing more than a sprig of \creatureref{stygian-nightshade}.
	However, it still only works on the corpses of creatures that died violent deaths.
	
	A \undeadref{wraith} appears just like a \undeadref{shade}, and uses all the same rules, except for two differences.
	Firstly, the \undeadref{wraith} can affect the physical world with full force; it loses no \attref{might}.
	
	Secondly, it sprouts wicked claws of stygian darkness, increasing the number of dice it rolls for {\unarmed} {\damagetests}.
	A creature without an effective attack gains one, and rolls 2 dice, while a creature with an existing attack rolls at least 3 dice.
	A human, or other creature with proper hands, rolls 5 dice.
}

\undead{Haunt}{Haunts}{souled}{
	%TODO: Souled, Haunts, or something else?
	A \undeadref{souled} is the result of necromancy that is beginning to lift itself from mere reanimation towards the ideal of resurrection.
	It is the result of imbuing a {\soul} into a more conventionally reanimated undead such as a \undeadref{zombie} or \undeadref{skeleton}.
	It is subject to the usual modifications to its statistics, as appropriate to the kind of reanimation.
	
	However, a \undeadref{souled} retains its memories, identity, and free will, and is not subject to the usual hunger.
	It is not controlled by the \practitioner{necromancy} who reanimated it.
	Furthermore, its \attref{might} and \attref{grace} are the only attributes subject to change; the other six are always unchanged.
	It retains all its skills and feats.
	It is still subject to all the benefits and detriments of its loss of biological processes, such as immunity to suffocation, disease, and potions.
	Lastly, it is still subject to usual rules for {\damage} and rotting, so may require \featref{undead-repair}.
	
	A creature can only be reanimated as a single \undeadref{souled} at a time, even when using feats such as \featref{undead-part}.
	
	Names for \undeadrefplural{souled} vary considerably, with many \undeadrefplural{souled} themselves finding the term unpleasant.
	They may refer to themselves as the Souled, or using some other name.
}

\section{Embalming}
\seclabel{embalming}

Decomposition can be such a pain for a \practitioner{necromancy}, putting valuable corpses to waste.
Most corpses barely last more than a week before they are too rotted to make some kinds of undead, such as \undeadrefplural{zombie} and \undeadrefplural{ghoul}.
A \practitioner{necromancy} can always strip away the flesh and raise \undeadrefplural{skeleton}, but these might not suit her needs.
Instead, she might turn to {\embalming}.

Anyone can attempt to {\embalm} a corpse.
The process is a mixture of surgery, and treatment with substances that slow decomposition.
Various substances can be used, with varying effectiveness.
Soaking a corpse in strong alcohol can preserve it for a month or more.
Drying it with salt can preserve it indefinitely, as long as it is not wetted again.
Very long periods of preservation can be achieved with dedicated \featref{embalming-fluid}.

\capital{\embalming} a corpse typically takes a few hours, and requires a \testtypespeciality{ken}{crafting}{Embalmer} {\test}.
Failure means that the corpse, or some parts of it, won't be preserved, or at least won't last as long as they could.
Particularly bad results can cause {\damage} to corpse.

\capital{\embalming} does nothing to repair {\damage} to the corpse, or to reduce rotting that has already occurred.
It only slows or prevents further rotting.

\section{Souls}
\seclabel{souls}

\capital{\discref{necromancy}} deals with death, after the {\soul} has been separated from the body.
Reanimation uses only the body, while resurrection seeks to reunite body and {\soul}.
Another branch of \discref{necromancy}, however, deals with bare {\souls}---{\ghosts}.

Every living creature has a {\soul}, of some sort.
The more intelligent, reasoning, and self-aware the creature, the stronger the soul.
Truly sapient creatures---humans---are referred to as {\strongsouled}.
Other animals are {\weaksouled}.
The {\souls} of plants, fungi, are the like as so weak as not to exist for any practical purpose---they do not even pass as {\weaksouled}.

Familiars are a particularly unusual case.
They share a shard of their witch's {\soul}, and so are considered to be {\strongsouled} for most purposes.
But some magics affect them strangely, due to their shared soul.

The strength of a {\soul} is a double-edged sword to a \practitioner{necromancy}.
\capital{\strongsouls} are much more substantial and easier to work with for a \practitioner{necromancy} using {\ghosts}.
But they also maintain a link to their own body, brought about by their self awareness.
This makes any body that bore a {\strongsoul} in life much harder to reanimate---the {\soul} must be severed from it first, or it will interfere with the animating energies.

During life, the {\soul} remains in the body.
And at the point of death, it departs the body, and passes through the veil to the afterlife.
Unless something goes wrong.
Sometimes, a {\soul} becomes stuck on this side of the veil, trapped in the mortal realm as a {\ghost}.
\capital{\practitioners{necromancy}} can facilitate this, preventing a {\soul} from passing over, or even reaching through the veil to pull a {\soul} back.

One point of note is that it is the departure of a witch's {\soul} from this realm that kills her familiar.
If a witch's {\soul} remains in this realm, as a {\ghost} or in a {\phylactery}, her familiar can continue to survive.

\subsection{Ghosts}
\seclabel{ghosts}

\capital{\ghosts} are {\souls} that have been unable to cross the veil to the afterlife, and remain trapped in the mortal realm.
Some are the intentional creation of \practitioners{necromancy}, magically bound to this realm.
But some also occur naturally.

When a creature, especially a {\strongsouled} creature, dies with unfinished business, it may remain in this realm as a {\ghost}.
The more important the unfinished business---often a matter of vengeance---the more likely a {\ghost} is to form, and the more powerful it is likely to be.
It will remain as long as the business that trapped it remains unfinished.
When the business is finally resolved, it can cross over the veil to the afterlife.
The GM can use these natural {\ghosts} in creating stories, whether or not there is a \practitioner{necromancy} in the coven.

As a creature's {\soul}, a {\ghost} retains most of the capabilities it had in life.
It keeps all attributes and skills.
It is still the same person it was in life---it retains its personality and all its memories, and has total free will.
Even {\ghosts} created by \practitioners{necromancy} are not bound to the \practitionerpossessive{necromancy} will.
However, a {\ghost} that has been drawn back across the veil has no memories of the afterlife, beyond a vague recollection that it is more pleasant than the mortal realm.
It is aware that time has passed, but doesn't know how long.

Despite retaining its skills, personality, and free will, a {\ghost} loses almost all ability to affect the world.
It cannot lift, carry, or move anything; it cannot exert any force on any objects or creatures.
To most people, it is invisible and inaudible, unable to be sensed---it doesn't even appear in the {\mentalrealm}.
People might be able to feel some slight presence, but often won't even realise it represents a {\ghost}.

A few people do learn to sense {\ghosts}, and a few {\ghosts} learn to be sensed by everybody.
To those people who can see ghosts, they appear much as they did in life, except partially transparent, and in muted colours.
However, they tend to appear as they saw themselves, not as how they actually were.
As such, human {\ghosts} tend to appear clothed, wearing their favourite clothes, or the clothes they believed typified them.
It is this need for self-conception that causes {\strongsouls} to form {\ghosts} far more often than {\weaksouls}.

Much as {\ghosts} can't affect objects, they aren't affected by most objects.
They can walk through walls, and pass through other objects and creatures---except other {\ghosts}.
They will not pass through the ground or floor, though, even if they want to, and must still walk upon such a surface.
In water, they can swim much as they did in life.
And, although they can pass through walls, magical barriers like the \featref{circle-contain} will still impede them.

\capital{\ghosts} are also immune to almost everything.
They cannot be harmed in any fashion---they do not suffer {\damage} or {\shock}.
They do not need to eat, breathe, drink, or sleep.
They cannot be affected by any potions, poisons, diseases, or the like.
They still suffer {\exhaustion}, although they will never pass out from suffering too much.
They recover from {\exhaustion} as normal, except that they do not need to sleep, just to rest.

The inability to affect the world also means that {\ghosts} of witches lose most ability to work magic.
They lose the benefit of all feats, for all intents and purposes.
They have not lost the knowledge required, but the world simply refuses to respond to their will.

Note that the above rules describe a typical {\ghost}: the weakest kind, the kind a novice \practitioner{necromancy} might create.
Some {\ghosts} become more powerful, through help from a \practitioner{necromancy}, from sheer effort of will, or from learning to affect the world once again.
The GM may add other abilities to naturally-occurring {\ghosts} as they see fit, possibly using the {\ghost} related feats in this chapter as inspiration.

\subsection{Phylacteries}
\seclabel{phylacteries}

Creating a {\ghost} is not the only way to bind a {\soul} to this realm.
All told, it's actually a rather messy way, with the {\soul} still running around inconveniently.
It's far neater, some \practitioners{necromancy} say, to seal the {\soul} inside a clay jar.
This creates a {\phylactery}.

A {\phylactery} is an object containing a person or other creature's {\soul}.
\capital{\phylacteries} must be created from a clay jar, at least the size of a fist but possibly larger.
They are no more robust than the jars they are created from, and their destruction frees the {\soul} within, letting it pass into the afterlife as if the person had just died.
Each person only has one {\soul}, so can only inhabit one {\phylactery}.
However, nothing prevents one jar serving as a {\phylactery} to multiple people.

Being trapped in a {\phylactery} is a kind of hell.
The {\soul} remains conscious, and aware of the passage of time.
However, it experiences no sensations of any kind, and cannot act in any fashion.
It has nothing but its own thoughts for company---a state which can drive a person mad before all too long.

\capital{\practitioners{projection}} can still form {\interfaces} to the mind of {\phylacterypossessive} inhabitant, perhaps providing some occasional relief from the isolation, but it cannot perform any \discref{projection} of its own.

	However small the part you reanimate, the result still counts as one undead under your control.
	
	The abilities of a reanimated part are determined by which part it is, and the GM should adjudicate this according to common sense.
	For example, a part without the head has no sense of sight, hearing, smell, or taste; only touch.
	Similarly, a single limb is likely to move more slowly than a full creature, and will suffer a considerable penalty to attacks---if it can attack at all.
	\capital{\statref{dodge-rating}} is also likely to be reduced.
	\capital{\statref{shock-threshold}} and \statref{resilience} are unlikely to be affected, however.
	Furthermore, the {\damage} the resulting undead part has sustained is determined only by the {\damage} to the relevant part, and it is not considered to have taken any {\damage} merely by being severed from the rest of the body.
	
	If you reanimate a part without a mouth, this causes problems when the creature breaks free of your control and becomes hungry.
	It cannot eat, so is behaviour will become increasingly erratic.

	Getting an enraged {\ghost} to hold still long enough for an \featref{exorcism} can be a real challenge, when you can't touch it.
	To this end, you have learned to enchant chains that can hold {\ghosts}.
	
	\materials{A \materialref{cold-iron} chain, salt}
	
	Enchanting the chain requires 5 minutes, and you must be touching the chain for the duration.
	It remains enchanted for 1 hour.
	During that time, it will touch {\ghosts}.
	They still cannot be harmed by it, but they can be restrained, and even moved around.
	
	The force that a {\ghost} can exert back upon the chain is very limited.
	It can't lift the chain, but it might be able to wriggle out of it if bound improperly.

}{
	After a person dies, it takes a moment for their {\soul} to cross the veil.
	If you catch it in that moment, you can bind it to this world as a {\ghost}.
	
	\materials{A \materialref{cold-iron} nail, the corpse of a {\strongsouled} creature that died since the start of your previous {\turn}}
	
	This requires an {\action}, driving the nail into the corpse.
	The creature's {\ghost} emerges from the corpse and remains in the mortal realm until the next sunrise, then its crosses over to the afterlife.
	Note that this occurs regardless of whether it can see the sunrise.

	\featref{ghost-creation},
	\featref{death-detection}
}{
	The opposite of \featref{exorcism}, you can reach through the veil and pluck a {\soul} back from the afterlife.
	You must do this where the veil has already been weakened: where the creature you want to make a {\ghost} of died.
	And you must do it before the veil heals: while you can still sense it with \featref{death-detection}.
	Lastly, it only works for {\strongsouled} creatures.
	
	\materials{A \circleref{small}, a \materialref{cold-iron} nail, three pinches of sugar, three drops of water}
	
	The ritual takes 5 minutes.
	At its completion, the {\soul} of the creature who died at the ritual's location is pulled back to this realm from the afterlife.
	It remains, as a {\ghost}, until the next sunrise, then fades back to the afterlife.
	Note that \featref{death-detection} doesn't give you any information as to \emph{who} died, so you may be in for a surprise when the {\ghost} arrives.
	
	Pulling a {\ghost} back through this weak point in the veil disrupts it badly, twisting it out of usefulness.
	It can still be sensed with \featref{death-detection}---even slightly more strongly---but it cannot be used for this ritual again.

}{
	A {\weaksoul} is harder to bind to this realm; it hardly has enough substance to for a {\ghost}.
	But you've learned to reinforce it with a little of your own will, to keep it around.
	You can create {\ghosts} of {\weaksouled} creatures using \featref{ghost-creation}---or using \featref{ghost-creation-point}, if you have it.
