\section{Reanimation and Resurrection}

Many \practitioners{necromancy} draw a distinction between reanimation and resurrection.
Reanimation is a crude process, somewhat akin to \discref{golemancy}.
It's nothing more than the application of raw animating force to a corpse, to stand it up and get it shuffling around again.
The creature retains its instincts, its muscle memory and the like, but that's as much through what is left of its biology as it is through the will that animated it.
The results of reanimation are known as the undead.

Resurrection, by contrast, brings a creature back back to life in full, and the creature's {\soul} is restored to its body.
There may be a few ill effects of the process, not to mention whatever killed it in the first place, but these can typically be recovered from.
For all intents and purposes, the creature is just as much alive as it was in the first place.

In theory, at least.

The trouble is that nobody has ever achieved true resurrection.
Dozens of witches and hundreds of charlatans have all claimed to.
Many have even come incredibly close, but there has always been some slight snag.
The search, of course, continues, but many have given up all hope that it is possible.

\section{The Undead}

Undead, the products of reanimation, come in many different forms: \undeadrefplural{zombie}, \undeadrefplural{skeleton}, \undeadrefplural{ghoul}, and more.
The statistics and capabilities of an undead creature are ultimately based upon those of the creature whose corpse is raised to create it.
However, each kind of undead comes with its own modifications to those statistics.
The rules detailing these modifications, for undead in general and for each specific type, can be found in \chapref{undead}.

\subsection{Reanimation Rituals}
\seclabel{reanimation-rituals}

For every kind of undead, there is a different ritual required to animate it.
However, all these rituals share mark{\'e}d similarities.
And many \practitioners{necromancy}, who consider these rituals to form the heart of the discipline, learn a lot of techniques for improving them.

For convenience, the feats which modify these rituals refer to them collectively as the {\reanimationrituals}, and the feats which provide them are listed here.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-zombie}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-skeleton}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-ghoul}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-draugr}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-sea-draugr}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-fossil}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-fire-skeleton}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-shade}}
	\item \capital{\featref{animate-wraith}}
\end{itemize}
Obviously, you cannot perform any variant of a ritual unless you have the feat to perform that ritual in the first place.

\subsection{Controlling the Undead}

When you reanimate a corpse, the resulting undead is under your control.
You control it mentally, without need for verbal instructions or gestures.
However, you can only maintain control while you remain conscious, and nearby---at least near enough to see or otherwise sense it.
If you fall asleep, fall unconscious, die, get too far away from the creature, or leave your body for the {\mentalrealm}, you lose control over it.
A novice \practitioner{necromancy} has no way to regain control over an undead creature once she loses it, other than to kill the creature and reanimate the corpse again.

When you lose control over an undead, it regains free will.
It begins to act as an animal of its kind normally would, seeking out whichever food it would normally eat.
However, it is eternally, ravenously, and insatiably hungry.
It's generally considered good practice to put an undead down, rather than to lose control of it.

A witch who can raise an undead creature learns to control one, and only one, at a time.
When you reanimate a second creature, you must either relinquish control of the previous one, or immediately lose control of the new one.

\section{Embalming}
\seclabel{embalming}

Decomposition can be such a pain for a \practitioner{necromancy}, putting valuable corpses to waste.
Most corpses barely last more than a week before they are too rotted to make some kinds of undead, such as \undeadrefplural{zombie} and \undeadrefplural{ghoul}.
A \practitioner{necromancy} can always strip away the flesh and raise \undeadrefplural{skeleton}, but these might not suit her needs.
Instead, she might turn to {\embalming}.

Anyone can attempt to {\embalm} a corpse.
The process is a mixture of surgery, and treatment with substances that slow decomposition.
Various substances can be used, with varying effectiveness.
Soaking a corpse in strong alcohol can preserve it for a month or more.
Drying it with salt can preserve it indefinitely, as long as it is not wetted again.
Very long periods of preservation can be achieved with dedicated \featref{embalming-fluid}.

\capital{\embalming} a corpse typically takes a few hours, and requires a \testtypespeciality{ken}{crafting}{Embalmer} {\test}.
Failure means that the corpse, or some parts of it, won't be preserved, or at least won't last as long as they could.
Particularly bad results can cause {\damage} to corpse.

\capital{\embalming} does nothing to repair {\damage} to the corpse, or to reduce rotting that has already occurred.
It only slows or prevents further rotting.

\section{Souls}
\seclabel{souls}

\capital{\discref{necromancy}} deals with death, after the {\soul} has been separated from the body.
Reanimation uses only the body, while resurrection seeks to reunite body and {\soul}.
Another branch of \discref{necromancy}, however, deals with bare {\souls}---{\ghosts}.

Every living creature has a {\soul}, of some sort.
The more intelligent, reasoning, and self-aware the creature, the stronger the soul.
Truly sapient creatures---humans---are referred to as {\strongsouled}.
Other animals are {\weaksouled}.
The {\souls} of plants, fungi, are the like as so weak as not to exist for any practical purpose---they do not even pass as {\weaksouled}.

Familiars are a particularly unusual case.
They share a shard of their witch's {\soul}, and so are considered to be {\strongsouled} for most purposes.
But some magics affect them strangely, due to their shared soul.

The strength of a {\soul} is a double-edged sword to a \practitioner{necromancy}.
\capital{\strongsouls} are much more substantial and easier to work with for a \practitioner{necromancy} using {\ghosts}.
But they also maintain a link to their own body, brought about by their self awareness.
This makes any body that bore a {\strongsoul} in life much harder to reanimate---the {\soul} must be severed from it first, or it will interfere with the animating energies.

During life, the {\soul} remains in the body.
And at the point of death, it departs the body, and passes through the veil to the afterlife.
Unless something goes wrong.
Sometimes, a {\soul} becomes stuck on this side of the veil, trapped in the mortal realm as a {\ghost}.
\capital{\practitioners{necromancy}} can facilitate this, preventing a {\soul} from passing over, or even reaching through the veil to pull a {\soul} back.

One point of note is that it is the departure of a witch's {\soul} from this realm that kills her familiar.
If a witch's {\soul} remains in this realm, as a {\ghost} or in a {\phylactery}, her familiar can continue to survive.

\subsection{Ghosts}
\seclabel{ghosts}

\capital{\ghosts} are {\souls} that have been unable to cross the veil to the afterlife, and remain trapped in the mortal realm.
Some are the intentional creation of \practitioners{necromancy}, magically bound to this realm.
But some also occur naturally.

When a creature, especially a {\strongsouled} creature, dies with unfinished business, it may remain in this realm as a {\ghost}.
The more important the unfinished business---often a matter of vengeance---the more likely a {\ghost} is to form, and the more powerful it is likely to be.
It will remain as long as the business that trapped it remains unfinished.
When the business is finally resolved, it can cross over the veil to the afterlife.
The GM can use these natural {\ghosts} in creating stories, whether or not there is a \practitioner{necromancy} in the coven.

As a creature's {\soul}, a {\ghost} retains most of the capabilities it had in life.
It keeps all attributes and skills.
It is still the same person it was in life---it retains its personality and all its memories, and has total free will.
Even {\ghosts} created by \practitioners{necromancy} are not bound to the \practitionerpossessive{necromancy} will.
However, a {\ghost} that has been drawn back across the veil has no memories of the afterlife, beyond a vague recollection that it is more pleasant than the mortal realm.
It is aware that time has passed, but doesn't know how long.

Despite retaining its skills, personality, and free will, a {\ghost} loses almost all ability to affect the world.
It cannot lift, carry, or move anything; it cannot exert any force on any objects or creatures.
To most people, it is invisible and inaudible, unable to be sensed---it doesn't even appear in the {\mentalrealm}.
People might be able to feel some slight presence, but often won't even realise it represents a {\ghost}.

A few people do learn to sense {\ghosts}, and a few {\ghosts} learn to be sensed by everybody.
To those people who can see ghosts, they appear much as they did in life, except partially transparent, and in muted colours.
However, they tend to appear as they saw themselves, not as how they actually were.
As such, human {\ghosts} tend to appear clothed, wearing their favourite clothes, or the clothes they believed typified them.
It is this need for self-conception that causes {\strongsouls} to form {\ghosts} far more often than {\weaksouls}.

Much as {\ghosts} can't affect objects, they aren't affected by most objects.
They can walk through walls, and pass through other objects and creatures---except other {\ghosts}.
They will not pass through the ground or floor, though, even if they want to, and must still walk upon such a surface.
In water, they can swim much as they did in life.
And, although they can pass through walls, magical barriers like the \featref{circle-contain} will still impede them.

\capital{\ghosts} are also immune to almost everything.
They cannot be harmed in any fashion---they do not suffer {\damage} or {\shock}.
They do not need to eat, breathe, drink, or sleep.
They cannot be affected by any potions, poisons, diseases, or the like.
They still suffer {\exhaustion}, although they will never pass out from suffering too much.
They recover from {\exhaustion} as normal, except that they do not need to sleep, just to rest.

The inability to affect the world also means that {\ghosts} of witches lose most ability to work magic.
They lose the benefit of all feats, for all intents and purposes.
They have not lost the knowledge required, but the world simply refuses to respond to their will.

Note that the above rules describe a typical {\ghost}: the weakest kind, the kind a novice \practitioner{necromancy} might create.
Some {\ghosts} become more powerful, through help from a \practitioner{necromancy}, from sheer effort of will, or from learning to affect the world once again.
The GM may add other abilities to naturally-occurring {\ghosts} as they see fit, possibly using the {\ghost} related feats in this chapter as inspiration.

\subsection{Phylacteries}
\seclabel{phylacteries}

Creating a {\ghost} is not the only way to bind a {\soul} to this realm.
All told, it's actually a rather messy way, with the {\soul} still running around inconveniently.
It's far neater, some \practitioners{necromancy} say, to seal the {\soul} inside a clay jar.
This creates a {\phylactery}.

A {\phylactery} is an object containing a person or other creature's {\soul}.
\capital{\phylacteries} must be created from a clay jar, at least the size of a fist but possibly larger.
They are no more robust than the jars they are created from, and their destruction frees the {\soul} within, letting it pass into the afterlife as if the person had just died.
Each person only has one {\soul}, so can only inhabit one {\phylactery}.
However, nothing prevents one jar serving as a {\phylactery} to multiple people.

Being trapped in a {\phylactery} is a kind of hell.
The {\soul} remains conscious, and aware of the passage of time.
However, it experiences no sensations of any kind, and cannot act in any fashion.
It has nothing but its own thoughts for company---a state which can drive a person mad before all too long.

\capital{\practitioners{projection}} can still form {\interfaces} to the mind of a {\phylacterypossessive} inhabitant, perhaps providing some occasional relief from the isolation, but it cannot perform any \discref{projection} of its own.

	Larger bodies need more force to reanimate, but it's force you've learned to provide.
	When you perform a {\reanimationritual}, you may use a \circleref{medium} instead of a \circleref{small}, in order to ignore the upper size limit on the creature.
	You still cannot reanimate a {\strongsouled} creature, such as a human; you need \featref{undead-human} to do so.
}

\feat{Undead Head}{undead-head}{10}{
	\featref{animate-zombie}
}{
	Rather than bothering to reanimate larger creatures, you can just reanimate parts of them.
	The head, specifically, the seat of consciousness.
	
	You may reanimate a creature's severed head using a {\reanimationritual}.
	The usual restrictions apply; for example, you cannot reanimate a human unless you also have \featref{undead-human}.
	However, when evaluating whether you need \featref{undead-large} and a \circleref{medium}, consider only the size of the creature's head, not the whole creature.
	As such, any head short of an elephant's only needs a \circleref{small}.
	
	The resulting creature has all the limitations you would expect from a severed head.
	It can't move, and can only bite people who put their hands in its mouth.
	It has no \attref{might} or \attref{grace} scores for most purposes, though it retains its \attref{might} score for calculating its \statref{shock-threshold}, and for biting.
	It can still see, hear, and so on, and vocalise or speak as it could in life.

\feat{Partial Undead}{undead-part}{15}{
	\skillref[1]{necromancy},
	\featref{undead-head}
}{
	Sometimes, a \practitioner{necromancy} has to make do with just the parts of corpses that they can find.
	Sometimes, of course, they just want a hand.
	
	You may reanimate just part of a creature using a {\reanimationritual}.
	As with \featref{undead-head}, you cannot reanimate a human without \featref{undead-human}, and whether you need to use \featref{undead-large} is determined by the size of the part you reanimate.
	However small the part you reanimate, the result still counts as one undead under your control.
	
	The abilities of a reanimated part are determined by which part it is, and the GM should adjudicate this according to common sense.
	For example, a part without the head has no sense of sight, hearing, smell, or taste; only touch.
	Similarly, a single limb is likely to move more slowly than a full creature, and will suffer a considerable penalty to attacks---if it can attack at all.
	\capital{\statref{dodge-rating}} is also likely to be reduced.
	\capital{\statref{shock-threshold}} and \statref{resilience} are unlikely to be affected, however.
	Furthermore, the {\damage} the resulting undead part has sustained is determined only by the {\damage} to the relevant part, and it is not considered to have taken any {\damage} merely by being severed from the rest of the body.
	
	If you reanimate a part without a mouth, this causes problems when the creature breaks free of your control and becomes hungry.
	It cannot eat, so is behaviour will become increasingly erratic.
	It may begin to simply hunt and stockpile food, or something else, at the GM's discretion.
	Partial \undeadrefplural{ghoul} are even worse; if they cannot be fed, they cannot be controlled at all.

	\skillref[1]{necromancy},
	\featref{undead-large} or \featref{undead-head}
}{
	Reanimating a creature that was once {\strongsouled} has previously been impossible, due to interference from the residual link.
	You've learned to sever these links, and hence reanimate these creatures.
	
	You may reanimate a {\strongsouled} creature, such as a human, or an animal that was a familiar, using a {\reanimationritual}.
	You must use an iron blade as part of the ritual, to sever the link.
	
	Reanimating an entire human requires a \circleref{medium}, and \featref{undead-large}.
	Reanimating smaller parts of a human, using \featref{undead-head} or \featref{undead-part}, may not.
	
	A reanimated familiar has lost the link to its witch, and is now just a normal animal of its kind.

}{
	By animating each bone of a \undeadref{skeleton} separately, you give it the ability to reassemble itself when scattered.
	When you animate a \undeadref{skeleton}, \undeadref{fossil}, or \undeadref{fire-skeleton}, you may give it this ability.
	This can make it quite hard to deanimate, however, so you can always choose to animate it without this ability.
	
	If an undead with this ability is destroyed by a {\damagetest}, or some other trauma that scatters its bones without destroying them, it does not lose animation.
	Over the next few minutes, the bones will draw themselves back together and reform the undead creature, which will begin normal operation again.
	The bones can be restrained to prevent this, but even so, will keep trying to draw themselves together, indefinitely.
	Even a \practitioner{necromancy} in control of the undead cannot give an order to prevent this; it is unresponsive to orders until reassembled.
	
	Thankfully, this does not entirely prevent deanimating the skeleton.
	It will lose animation if enough of the bones are broken, or, in the case of a \undeadref{fire-skeleton}, extinguished.
	Alternatively, the \featref{deanimate} ritual still works.

	You have learned an obscure ritual to emulate the legendary phoenix, creating an avian undead that is reborn from fire in an instant.
	When you use \featref{animate-fire-skeleton} on the bones of a flying bird, you may use this feat.
	If you do so, the resulting undead gains all the effects of \featref{skeleton-reassemble}, as well as several extra benefits.
	
	Firstly, despite its skeletal nature, the bird can fly just as well as it could in life.
	Secondly, its flame burns unstoppably; it cannot be extinguished in any way, except by deanimating it.
	Lastly, it can reassemble itself faster, taking only moments, not minutes.
	After it is destroyed, it reforms on its next {\turn}, though it cannot do anything else on that {\turn}.
	
	However, it is said that the phoenix is a unique bird---that only one ever exists at a time.
	While not quite true here, \emph{you} can certainly only create one.
	The last one you created must lose animation before you can animate another one---it is not enough to simply lose control of it.

\feat{Undead Familiar}{reanimate-familiar}{10}{

	While a {\soul} normally interferes with reanimating a creature, you've begun to figure out how to use it to your advantage, beginning on the path towards resurrection.
	Unfortunately, you can't actually summon any {\souls} back to their bodies yet.
	Not to worry, though, for you have quite ready access to one {\soul} in particular: your familiar's, so inextricably bound to your own.
	
	If your familiar dies and you can recover the corpse, you can reanimate it, paying no XP cost beside that required to purchase this feat in the first place.
	You may use any {\reanimationritual}, and it becomes the appropriate kind of \undeadref{souled}.
	
	Reanimating a familiar in this way does not prevent recovering it through the usual repetition of the binding ritual later (see the section \secref{familiar-injury-death}), although the normal XP cost must still be paid each time that method used.

\feat{Self-Sacrifice}{phylactery-self}{10}{
	\skillref[1]{necromancy}

	Much of \discref{necromancy}---particularly efforts at resurrection---requires {\phylacteries}.
	They aren't easy to come by, however.
	The easiest way to acquire one, as is so often the case, is to make it yourself.
	Or, more precisely, to make it \emph{from} yourself.
	
	\materials{The clay jar to become the {\phylactery}, a drop of your own blood, \herb[deadly nightshade]{belladonna}{2}, a \circleref{medium}}
	
	The ritual requires 1 minute, and must be performed in a dark place.
	It is lethal, by its very aim---it tears your {\soul} free from your body and traps it in the {\phylactery}.
	
	Before killing yourself this way, you should have a plan to restore yourself.
	Examples include using the \featref{reanimate-souled} ritual simultaneously, a resurrection pact with a trustworthy friend who has the \featref{reanimate-souled} feat, having your familiar resurrect you (\featref{reanimate-souled-familiar}), or ensuring you can stick around to resurrect yourself (\featref{projection-phylactery}).

	Creating a \undeadref{souled} has proven easier than you expected.

	You may substitute a {\phylactery} for the lit candle in any {\reanimationritual}, and use the {\soul} within to reanimate the corpse as the appropriate kind of \undeadref{souled}.
	The {\soul} in the {\phylactery} must be the {\soul} from the body you are reanimating, however.
	
	Even when using this, you are subject to the usual limits of the {\reanimationritual} you use.
	As such, you need \featref{undead-large}, \featref{undead-head}, or \featref{undead-part} to reanimate a human.
	However, you may work with a {\strongsouled} creature even without \featref{undead-human}---you are incorporating the {\soul}, not severing it.
	
	The difficulty in using this feat, of course, lies in finding or creating a {\phylactery}.
	As such, this feat is only normally useful in conjunction with \featref{phylactery-self}. %TODO: List other useful feats.

	However, it is only the link between the {\soul} in your {\phylactery} and the sliver of the same {\soul} in your familiar that affords it the magical intuition to do this.

\feat{Touching the Veil}{death-detection}{10}{

	When a {\soul} departs our world for the next, its passage disrupts the veil between worlds.
	A witch who knows what to look for can feel this disruption.
	
	You can feel where creatures have died, though this sense is damped by both distance and time.
	If you pass through the actual position of the death of a {\strongsouled} creature, you'll notice for up to about two weeks after it occurred.
	You automatically sense a {\strongsouled} death in the same room for a few days after it's happened, and in the same house for only about a day.
	The deaths of {\weaksouled} creatures fade even faster.
	
	A {\test} can reveal slightly older or more distant deaths, if you are searching for them.
	However, you can't gain any information about the identity of the victim or the cause of death.
	
	Locations of mass or repeated death can leave their traces lingering for much longer.
	The site of a battlefield or sacrificial altar may be felt for many years after.
