\discipline{Sympathetic Magic}{sympathetic-magic}{Sympathist}{Sympathists}

\capital{\discref{sympathetic-magic}} is a far more improvisational discipline than, say, \discref{brewing}, or \discref{ritual-magic}.
There are no rites and recipes to remember.
It is about seeing similarities wherever you can find them, and leveraging them for all they're worth.
As such, Tests to use \discref{sympathetic-magic} tend to use \attref{wit} as their attribute.

\section{Sympathetic Links \& Symbols}
\seclabel{sympathetic-links}

Central to the practice of \discref{sympathetic-magic} is the creation and manipulation of {\symbols}.
A {\symbol} is a representation of a creature or object, and by affecting the {\symbol} a witch may cause a mirroring effect upon the target.
Not every \materialref{poppet} or \materialref{effigy} is automatically a {\symbol}.
It must by magically bound to the target by a {\symlink}.

A novice witch---who has taken any one \discref{sympathetic-magic} feat---can maintain one, and only one, {\symlink} at a time.
It's not that maintaining one is particularly arduous; once established, maintaining a {\symlink} requires no effort from the witch.
Rather, two {\symlinks} tend to tangle themselves up, like pieces of string left together in a drawer.
Soon enough, both are totally useless and they have to be cut to separate them.
Although maintaining a {\symlink} is not arduous, and a witch can manage it even in her sleep, her links do still vanish when she dies.

A {\symlink} by itself does nothing, but a \practitioner{sympathetic-magic} soon learns to use it to transmit numerous things: sensations, physical effects and more.
A {\symlink} doesn't always transmit everything it is capable of transmitting: only what the witch who established it wants it to.
The witch can change what the link transmits at any point she chooses, regardless of proximity to the {\symbol} or the target.
However, she has no particular sense of what is being transmitted by the link, and must watch the {\symbol} or the target if she wants to know.
As such, leaving {\symbols} lying around is a slightly dangerous proposition.

\subsection{Establishing a Sympathetic Link}
\seclabel{establish-sympathetic-link}

There are several methods for establishing a {\symlink}.
A witch with any \discref{sympathetic-magic} feat learns to one method, described here, while some feats will grant other methods.

The simplest method for establishing a {\symlink} is known as the {\methodofcontagion}.
It simply requires touching the {\symbol} to the target, using an {\action}.
At first, the witch can only establish {\symlinks} with people and creatures as the target, using a \materialref{poppet} or \materialref{effigy} as the {\symbol}.

\subsection{Severing a Sympathetic Link}

Once established, a {\symlink} remains in place for about 10 minutes.
A witch can sever one of her own {\symlinks} earlier, as an {\action}, or as part of establishing any new {\symlink}.
Additionally, a {\symlink} is severed if the {\symbol}, the target, or the witch who established the link dies, or is destroyed.

\subsection{Stress and Strength}
\seclabel{stress-sympathetic-link}

Many uses of \discref{sympathetic-magic} are passive, and can be constantly transmitted along a {\symlink}.
Others are more sudden, causing an instantaneous effect upon the target.
Some of the more potent instantaneous effects can overwhelm a {\symlink}, {\stressing} it.
Uses of a {\symlink} that {\stress} it will say so in their relevant feats.

\capital{\symlinks} established by different methods differ in their strength---their responses to {\stress}.
A {\symlink} is either {\weaksymlinkbare}, {\standardsymlinkbare}, or {\strongsymlinkbare}.
\capital{\symlinks} established by the {\methodofcontagion} are {\standardsymlinkbare}.

A {\weaksymlink} cannot handle {\stress}.
Not only does {\stress} immediately break the {\symlink}---it utterly fails to transmit any effect that would {\stress} it.
Note that you can always try not to transmit anything that \emph{would} {\stress} the link, in order to avoid breaking it.

A {\strongsymlink} is the opposite; it is immune to any ill effects of {\stress}.
It transmits any effect that would {\stress} it, with no chance of breaking.
Having a {\strongsymlink} to a target can put them almost entirely at your mercy.

A {\standardsymlink} lies in between.
It will always transmit any effect that would {\stress} it, but it risks breaking afterwards.
Make a \testtype{wit}{sympathetic-magic} {\opposed} by the target's \testtype{will}{sympathetic-magic}.
If the target wins the Test, the {\symlink} is broken.
However, if the target is aware of the {\symlink}, and wishes to maintain it, they can help you to hold it in place.
In this case, there is no risk of it breaking.

\section{Feats}

\feat{Object Linking}{symlink-object}{10}{
	\Anyfeat{sympathetic-magic}
}{
	A novice only knows how to form {\symlinks} from objects to creatures.
	You've learned how to form a link between two objects.
	
	You still do so using the {\methodofcontagion}, touching one object to the other as an {\action}.
	The two objects must be recognisably similar---similar in the same way a \materialref{poppet} is similar to a human.
	For example, you could link a pebble to a boulder, a knife to a sword, or one boat to another.
	You decide when you create the link which object is the {\symbol}, and which is the target.
	
	Note that many \discref{sympathetic-magic} effects only affect creatures, not objects.
	If it not specified, whether an effect works against an object is left up the GM, who may call for a Test to make it work.
}

\feat{Linking People}{symlink-creature}{10}{
	\skillref[1]{sympathetic-magic},
	\anyfeat{sympathetic-magic}
}{
	You have learned to link two creatures together, using the {\methodofcontagion}.
	They must be the same kind of creature---you can only link humans to humans, or bears to bears.
	You decide when you create the {\symlink} which creature is the {\symbol}, and which is the target.
}

\feat{Stability in Contagion}{symlink-stable-duration}{10}{
	\Anyfeat{sympathetic-magic}
}{
	By spending longer establishing a {\symlink}, you can make it last for longer too.
	If you touch the {\symbol} to the target for 5 minutes when using the {\methodofcontagion}, the resulting {\symlink} does not expire over time---it lasts indefinitely.
}

\feat{Stability in Imitation}{symlink-stable-effigy}{10}{
	\Anyfeat{sympathetic-magic}
}{
	A {\symlink} will typically expire before too long, but you've learned to stabilise your links against this, leaving them fastened strong in the face of adversity.
	You can make your {\symlinks} last indefinitely, not expiring over time, if the {\symbol} is an imitation of the target.
	That is, not just the same rough shape as the target, but recognisably an imitation of the target itself.
	
	For a typical {\symlink}, from an object to creature, this means that the {\symbol} must be a \materialref{effigy}, instead of merely a \materialref{poppet}.
	For links between two creatures, this requires them to be identical twins, or doppelgangers.
	For links between two objects, one object must be a recognisable model of the other.
	As such, links between two objects are not always possible.
	It is very hard to make a recognisable model of a generic boulder, but it might be possible to make a recognisable model of a particular sword, or boat.
}

\feat{Taglock Binding}{symlink-taglock}{20}{
	\Anyfeat{sympathetic-magic}
}{
	Normally, contact between the {\symbol} and target is required to establish a {\symlink}.
	You have learned to use only a \emph{piece} of the target for this purpose, though the resulting link is not as strong.
	
	You can establish {\symlinks} to creatures, using a \materialref{taglock}, and a \materialref{poppet} or \materialref{effigy} as the {\symbol}.
	Establishing the {\symlink} uses an {\action}, while touching the \materialref{taglock} and the {\symbol}.
	However, this creates a {\weaksymlink}.
}

\feat{I Bind You}{symlink-declare}{20}{
	\skillref[1]{sympathetic-magic},
	\anyfeat{sympathetic-magic}
}{
	Touching a {\symbol} to a target can be a little inconvenient, especially against an unwilling target.
	Thankfully, a little trick of \discref{headology} can give you another way to establish a {\symlink}.
	
	This requires an {\action}, and creates a {\standardsymlink} from a \materialref{poppet} or \materialref{effigy} to a person or creature.
	To establish the link, you must make the target \emph{expect} the link, and show them the {\symbol}.
	Most \practitioners{sympathetic-magic} use a phrase such as ``I bind you'', or some other mumbo jumbo that suits the mystique they wish to cultivate.
	
	Against people that can understand your speech, establishing a {\symlink} this way is easy, and does not normally require a Test.
	Against a creature that doesn't understand you, you must find some other way to make them expect the link.
	\capital{\featref{animal-language}}, \featref{animal-language-2}, and \featref{animal-language-speed} may be useful for using this method upon animals.
}

\feat{Link Reversal}{symlink-reverse}{10}{
	\Anyfeat{sympathetic-magic}
}{
	You may use your own {\symlinks} in both directions.
	Anything that you could normally transmit from {\symbol} to target, you can choose to instead, or additionally, transmit from target to {\symbol}.
	
	Note that many \discref{sympathetic-magic} effects will only affect creatures, and not objects.
	With the typical variety of {\symlink}, the reversed link is targeting an object, and many effects will be useless.
}

\feat{Twin Links}{symlink-extra}{20}{
	\skillref[1]{sympathetic-magic},
	\anyfeat{sympathetic-magic}
}{
	You may maintain two {\symlinks} simultaneously.
}

\feat{Triple Links}{symlink-extra-2}{15}{
	\skillref[2]{sympathetic-magic},
	\anyfeat{sympathetic-magic}
}{
	You may maintain three {\symlinks} simultaneously.
}

\feat{Sympathetic Jerk}{sympathetic-puppet}{15}{
	\noprereq
}{
	An expert \practitioner{sympathetic-magic} can make their target dance on the puppet strings of their {\symlink}.
	You aren't there yet, but you've taken the first step.
	
	You cannot control your target's movements, but you---or someone else holding the {\symbol}---can \emph{disrupt} them by jerking the {\symbolpossessive} limb the wrong way at the opportune time.
	If the target is just walking and talking normally, this doesn't do more than faintly disturb them.
	But if they are performing something highly physical or precise---running, jumping, aiming a weapon, or sewing, for example---it can severely disrupt them.
	Jerking the correct limb at the correct time requires knowing what the target is doing, or at least being able to take a very good guess.
	Normally, this means being able to see them.
	
	Typically, you can use this by taking the \actionref{ready} {\action} in order to disrupt the target's next {\action}, while holding their {\symbol}.
	Common disruptions include making them miss an attack, or making them trip and fall prone when jumping or taking the \actionref{dash} {\action}.
	The GM ultimately decides the result of any disruption.
	Disruptions like those listed above do not require a Test, but if the outcome is in doubt, the GM may call for an {\opposedtest}.
	This typically uses \testtype{wit}{sympathetic-magic} for the witch, and might use something like \testtype{grace}{athletics} or \testtype{grace}{weaponry} for the target.
}

\feat{Sympathetic Puppet}{sympathetic-puppet-2}{25}{
	\skillref[1]{sympathetic-magic},
	\featref{sympathetic-puppet}
}{
	You can control someone's actions through a {\symlink}.
	Only intermittently, and not precisely, but that doesn't make it much less terrifying.
	
	As an {\action}, someone can puppet a target by manipulating its linked {\symbolpossessive} limbs.
	The manipulator takes a physical {\action} on behalf of the target, which may be moving up to its \statref{speed} using the \actionref{dash} {\action}.
	This also deprives the target of their {\action} on their next {\turn}---unless that {\action} would be purely non-physical---although they may still make their usual movement.
	
	Using this {\stresses} the {\symlink}.
	
	Puppetry is quite difficult to do precisely.
	You can control limbs, and you can even open and close the hands and jaw, if the {\symbol} has the appropriate anatomy to manipulate.
	But speaking is impossible, and any work with the fingers requires you to manipulate the {\symbolpossessive} fingers with the same precision---a difficult proposition using your own bulky fingers.
	
	The manipulator suffers a \negative{6} penalty to any \emph{physical} Tests they must make on the target's behalf.
	These Tests typically use \attref{grace}, to finely manipulate the {\symbol}, and whichever skill would be used for performing the {\action} normally.
	However, \skillrefspeciality{performance}{Puppetry} can be used in place of the normal skill.
}

\feat{Sympathetic Destruction}{sympathetic-damage}{20}{
	\noprereq
}{
	When a {\symbol} is destroyed, you can send its death throes lashing along the {\symlink}, tearing at its target.
	Roll a {\damagetest} against the target, using \skillref{sympathetic-magic} with no attribute.
	This works against objects, as well as creatures.
	
	Tearing a {\symbol} apart typically requires an {\action}, though you might find a faster way to destroy it.
	The destruction of the {\symbol} obviously terminates the {\symlink}.
	Furthermore, it {\stresses} the link, so this does not work on a {\weaksymlink}.
}

\feat{Sympathetic Stabbing}{sympathetic-damage-2}{15}{
	\skillref[1]{sympathetic-magic},
	\featref{sympathetic-damage}
}{
	You no longer need to destroy a {\symbol} outright to wound the target.
	When a {\symbol} is significantly damaged in some way---sticking a pin in it is traditional---you may roll a {\damagetest} against the target, using \skillref{sympathetic-magic} with no attribute.
	This works against objects, as well as creatures.
	Using this effect {\stresses} the {\symlink}.
	
	Attacking a {\symbol} to activate this should typically require an {\action}, though you might find a faster way to damage it.

\feat{Sympathetic Surgery}{sympathetic-healing}{10}{
	\skillref[1]{sympathetic-magic},
	\featref{symlink-reverse},
	\featref{sympathetic-damage-2}
}{
	Using \featref{symlink-reverse}, you can cause a target's wounds to appear on their {\symbol}.
	Now, you can treat the {\symbolpossessive} wounds in order to heal the target.
	
	You can treat the injuries of a target by treating the injuries of their {\symbol}.
	This uses your choice of \skillref{healing}, or a \skillref{crafting} speciality appropriate to the construction of the {\symbol} you are using.
	Otherwise, it is as though you were treating the target directly.
	However, you can only treat wounds that the target has sustained since the {\symlink} was established, that were transmitted to the {\symbol}.
	
	You can only perform physical treatment this way; medicines cannot be transmitted.
	Any malpractice is treated as \featref{sympathetic-damage-2}, which {\stresses} the {\symlink}.
	
	The target does not need to be a creature to use this; you can also repair an object this way.
	This always uses \skillref{crafting}, not \skillref{healing}.
}

\feat{Sympathetic Re-Wounding}{sympathetic-healing-2}{10}{
	\skillref[1]{sympathetic-magic},
	\featref{sympathetic-healing}

	You can cause a {\symbol} to develop wounds that its target sustained before the {\symlink} was established.
	This allows you to treat such wounds using \featref{sympathetic-healing}.
	
	You may only cause wounds to develop this way upon an object, not a creature.
}

\feat{Sympathetic Buoyancy}{sympathetic-weight}{10}{

	%TODO: Mechanical effects on jumping, etc.
	
	This effect can be used on objects as well as creatures, making them easier or harder to lift and carry.
}

\feat{Sympathetic Sleep}{sympathetic-sleep}{10}{
	\noprereq
}{
	A {\symbol} can rest in place of its target, allowing the target to work through most of the night.
	The rest, the {\symbol} needs to be tucked into a small bed, with soft bedding, a pillow, and sheets.
	It needs to be in a quiet, dim location, and generally to be in conditions where a person could easily sleep.
	The {\symbol} cannot be used for any other \discref{sympathetic-magic} while it is resting.
	
	As long as the {\symbol} rests for at least 8 hours each day, the target can get by on only 1 hour of sleep each day without any ill effects.
	However, the target does not recover from {\damage} and {\exhaustion} as a result of this rest.
	
	Note that {\symlinks} only last 10 minutes, so unless you use \featref{symlink-stable-effigy} or \featref{symlink-stable-duration}, you will need to keep refreshing the link throughout the night.

	If the {\symbol} is subjected to loud noises, bright lights, stony bedding, or other significant discomforts while the target sleeps, the sleep will be fitful and restless.
	The sleep does not help them recover from {\damage} or {\exhaustion}, although they may still recover 1 point of {\damage} and 1 level of {\exhaustion} from a {\dayofrest}.
