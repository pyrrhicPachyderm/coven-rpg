\section{Contract Law}
\seclabel{contracts}

\capital{\contracts} are among the most complicated of all magics.
In fact, much of the skill in using {\contracts} lies in making them complicated enough to hide loopholes, or catches, to dupe the other party and come out on top.
The other side of the coin is understanding them well enough to avoid being caught out by the same tricks.

Some players, and some GMs, will revel in this complication, loving the battle of wits as they open and close loopholes in the {\contracts} they write.
Others, however, will think it too much like work, preferring not to bog down play with such details.
As such, there are two ways to use {\contracts} in your game.
The players and GM should agree on which method is being used before anyone takes feats from this chapter, to avoid confusion and disappointment.

The first way is to write them yourself---word for word.
You can even put your character's signature upon them---perhaps in red pen---and use the piece of paper as a prop around the game table.
The GM might offer you the chance to make a {\test} to spot a loophole, if they see one that you haven't, but ultimately, the words written upon the paper are the words that form the {\contract} in-game.

The second method is for you just describe the intent of the contract to the GM.
The GM can then call for a {\test}---possibly {\opposed} by the other party in the {\contract}---for your character to draft the {\contract}.
On a failure, the GM can invent a loophole to catch you out on, while on a success you write a clean {\contract}, or could even catch the other party out.

\capital{\tests} related to {\contracts} use the \skillrefspeciality{lore}{Contracts} skill.
Unlike most \skillref{lore} skills, which are typically paired with \attref{ken}, most \skillrefspeciality{lore}{Contracts} {\tests} will use \attref{wit}.
Writing and spotting loopholes and other tricks is less about rote learning, and more about outwitting the other parties to the {\contract}.

\subsection{Creating Contracts}

In-game, a {\contract} is a magical agreement brought into existence using a written document, signed in \materialref{blood}.
A {\contract} consists of three parts: {\stipulations}, {\penalties}, and {\signatories}.
All three must be present on the written document.
The words upon the document form the binding rules of the {\contract}---any spoken agreements do not matter, only what is written.

There are two steps to creating a {\contract}.
The first is writing the document, specifying the {\stipulations}, the {\penalties}, and who the {\signatories} are to be.
The second is getting each {\signatory} to {\sign} the document.
The document must not be modified during the second step.
If it is altered at any point after the first {\signatory} {\signs}, but before the last {\signatory} {\signs}, then it becomes {\void}.

Once the last {\signatory} signs it, the {\contract} takes effect.
Every {\signatory} is immediately, magically aware of this, regardless of whether they are currently present.
From this point onwards, the document used to create the {\contract} is no longer relevant.
It can be modified, or destroyed, without affecting the terms of the {\contract} itself.

Not just anyone can write a magically-binding {\contract}, although anyone can {\sign} one.
At least one of the people writing---and {\signing}---the {\contract} must have the feat \featref{contracts}, in order to make it magically binding.

Several feats allow extra clauses to be specified upon a {\contract} that a person helps to write.
Firstly, note that a person must be a {\signatory} upon the {\contract} in order to use these---unless they have the \featref{contracts-others} feat.
Secondly, while a witch must learn the feat \featref{contracts} before learning any of these feats, some other creatures may have these feats without being able to write a {\contract} independently. %TODO: Link to demons.
In this case, they can add these clauses to a {\contract} they help to write, and {\sign}, but they need someone with the \featref{contracts} to create the {\contract} in the first place.

\subsection{Signatories}
\seclabel{contract-signatories}

A {\contract} comes into effect when it is {\signed} in \materialref{blood}, by everyone it is to affect directly.
A {\contract} must specify all its {\signatories} as part of the main text, before anyone {\signs} it.
These specified {\signatories} are the only people who may be directly affected by the {\penalties} of the {\contract}---they are the ones who have agreed to its terms.

A {\signature} does not need to be a name; it is often just an ``X'', or a paw-print.
The important aspects are that it is made by the {\signatory}, in the {\signatorypossessive} \materialref{blood}, with the intent to {\sign} the {\contract}.
Note that, although they must intend to {\sign} the {\contract}, they might be doing so reluctantly.
A {\contract} {\signed} under duress is still valid.
Furthermore, there is no requirement that the {\signatory} has even read the {\contract}.

\subsection{Stipulations}
\seclabel{contract-stipulations}

The first part of a {\contract}, apart from the list of {\signatories}, is the {\stipulations}.
These specify a set of things that must (or must not) happen, and which {\signatory} is responsible for ensuring they occur.
For example ``Agatha must ensure that Brynston Tower falls by midnight,'' or ``Agatha must not tell anyone about the Sword of Queen Grima.''

\capital{\stipulations} may specify a time in which they must happen, but they do not have to.
It is not always necessary---``Agatha must not tell anyone about the Sword of Queen Grima'' simply applies forever.
But for cases where it is necessary, its omission provides a common loophole.
For example, ``Agatha must ensure that Brynston Tower falls'' is a {\stipulation} that Agatha can never be {\penalised} for breaking, as there is always the possibility that it will fall at some later date.

If a {\stipulation} is violated---and any one of the {\signatories} becomes aware of the violation---then the {\penalties} take effect upon the {\signatory} who violated them.
If multiple {\signatories} violate their {\stipulations}, they are all {\penalised}.

Note that, unlike most \discref{headology}, it is not only belief that matters.
A {\signatory} must be aware of the violation, but the violation must also have actually occurred.
Also, note that the {\signatory} who learns about the violation may be the same {\signatory} who will be penalised for it---you can never get away with intentionally breaching {\contract}.
If there is some ambiguity about whether a {\stipulation} has been violated, then the GM is the final arbiter.
However, the GM may call for the {\signatories} to argue their cases, perhaps with associated {\tests}.

\subsection{Penalties}
\seclabel{contract-penalties}

Accompanying each {\stipulation} in a {\contract}, there should be a {\contractpenalty}.
One {\contractpenalty} may cover multiple {\stipulations}, and violation of one {\stipulation} may trigger multiple {\penalties}.
However, {\penalties} can only affect the {\signatories} who violated the associated {\stipulations}.

Several varieties of {\contractpenalty} are possible in a {\contract}, but only one is possible for a novice {\contract}-writer.
Others must be learned through feats.
Every {\signatory} upon a {\contract} becomes aware when a {\stipulation} is violated and a {\contractpenalty} takes effect.

The standard {\contractpenalty} is forced action for the {\signatory} who violated the {\stipulation}.
The {\contract} should specify exactly what they have to do, and, if they violate their {\stipulation}, the magic of the {\contract} compels them to carry out the {\contractpenalty} to the best of their ability.
The most common case is to simply force them to carry out the {\stipulation} they violated, but others are possible.

In this case of a forced action {\contractpenalty}, the {\penalised} {\signatory} is magically compelled to carry it out above all else.
In most cases they will retain a sense of self-preservation, but only so far as it is helps them to carry out the {\contractpenalty}.
A {\contractpenalty} requiring a suicidal action overrides even this, however.
As such, being under a {\contractpenalty} can be very dangerous.
The magical compulsion continues until the {\contractpenalty} is completed---which may never happen, depending on how it is phrased.

If a player character winds up under a {\contractpenalty}, it should normally be possible to leave the player in control, as long as they co-operate.
They character is in control of \emph{how} they attempt to fulfil the {\penaltypossessive} obligations, as long as they give it their best effort.
However, the GM retains the right to take some control if the player is not following their character's magical compulsion.

\subsection{Voiding a Contract}
\seclabel{contract-void}

Various situations can cause a {\contract} to become {\void}.
The most common one is when a {\contract} is modified while it is being {\signed}---after the first {\signatory} {\signs}, but before the last one does.

Otherwise, a {\contract} can specify conditions under which it renders itself {\void}.
These conditions must be detected be a {\signatory}, just like any violations of {\stipulations}.

If a {\contract} becomes {\void} before it takes effect---if it modified while it is being {\signed}, for instance---then it can never take effect.
Anybody who later tries to {\sign} the {\contract} is aware that it is {\void}.
An entirely new document must be created in order to bring a {\contract} into effect.

If a {\contract} becomes {\void} some time \emph{after} it takes effect, then all its effects immediately end.
No new {\penalties} can take effect from that {\contract}.
Furthermore, any ongoing {\penalties} immediately end, removing any magical compulsions.
Every {\signatory} on the {\contract} becomes aware when an active {\contract} is {\voided}.

	It is very difficult to undo a {\contract} once it has come into effect, but with agreement of all the original {\signatories}, it can be done.
	A {\contract} can normally contain clauses that {\void} it under certain conditions.
	Now, when you create, or help to create, a {\contract}, you may add clauses that {\void} previous {\contracts}: either immediately, or under certain conditions.
	These conditions must still be detected by a {\signatory}, as usual.
	
	For this to work, every {\signatory} upon the {\contract} to be {\voided} must be a {\signatory} on the new {\contract}.
	Exactly which previous {\contracts} are to be {\voided} must be specified.
	You may also create a {\contract} without {\stipulations} or {\penalties}, with the sole purpose of {\voiding} earlier {\contracts}.
