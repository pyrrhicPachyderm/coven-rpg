%TODO: Note that some of these are discipline feats, and some are familiar feats.
%Maybe separate them.

}{
	A \familiarref{crow} is a potent omen, even if it's your familiar.
	You may use your familiar as the required bird for \featref{foresight-birds}.
	If you do so, you may use your familiar's \skillref{divination} skill in place of your own for any {\tests} as part of that \featref{foresight}, even if you cannot consult properly with it.
	
	If you also have \featref{foresight-birds-2}, you can use your familiar as one of the seven required birds, and gain the same benefit from doing so.
